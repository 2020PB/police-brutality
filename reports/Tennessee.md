### Sheriffs tear gas crowd after accidental vandalism | 2020-05-31

Footage from the first link shows two protesters attempting to remove a sign strung between two lampposts on the County Courthouse mezzanine. The lampposts fall over during this process. Then at 00:40, officers rush out of the building, seizing protesters.

The second clip shows officers with rifles making arrests on the mezzanine. Officers then pull what appear to be service pistols and point them at protesters. More officers step out of the building onto the mezzanine and take the staircase. Protesters and police face each other at the foot of the stairs. Protesters begin chanting.

The third clip shows police dropping tear gas canisters from the mezzanine. Protesters flee.

The fourth clip shows protesters attempt to recover their belongings while police launch more tear gas. Protesters flee to the far sidewalk as police move into the street.

An article from the Chattanoogan states Sheriffs threw the tear gas, not Chattanooga police.
