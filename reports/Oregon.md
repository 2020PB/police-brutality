### Officer forces press away from protest | June 8th

A reporter with a press pass is told that his pass does not matter and press is not permitted at the scene. Later, a second officer states the same thing.

After asking again, the officer threatens the journalist, saying: "Do you want to go to jail?" before grabbing the journalist and arresting them.
