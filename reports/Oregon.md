### Police and federal agents tackle, arrest, and tear gas protesters | 2020-07-12

In what is allegedly the fourth distinct tear gassing of the night, federal agents and police charged out from the US District Courthouse. They tackle and arrest at least one protester, then deploy tear gas to cover their retreat. In addition, officers are seen shoving both protesters and journalists, and threatening them with batons while pushing protests out of the park. They continually disperse tear gas while doing so. In particular, the last link shows an officer pushing an individual clearly marked press off a set of steps and into bushes.

### Federal officers retaliate to protesters with tear gas, flashbangs and impact munitions | 2020-07-21

After a small group of protesters damaged the plywood barricade on the US District Courthouse doors around 12:30 AM PST, federal agents emerged from the US District Courthouse and deployed a variety of riot control munitions against all protesters for a period lasting about half an hour. These munitions include tear gas, flashbangs and unknown less-lethal projectiles.

Prior to emerging, officers dropped a tear gas canister out of a window in the barricade, seen [here](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1285465270685859841).

One reporter [states](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1285465270685859841) he was shoved by an officer, but does not have any supporting footage.

[This footage](https://twitter.com/MrOlmos/status/1285480573981491203) from reporter Sergio Olmos shows officers grabbing protesters who are passively resisting and brandishing batons at others. This footage also shows a protester using a leafblower to redirect tear gas.

[This footage](https://twitter.com/defendpdx/status/1285481849372831749) shows officers throwing explosives at a protester attempting to collect garbage from the street.

It appears that protesters did damage part of the plywood barricade around the US District Courthouse doors, seen [here](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1285482389628583936).

An [image](https://twitter.com/ProudBulba/status/1285671820637732867) from a protester shows a wound received allegedly at this protest. The protester also displays the projectile that hit her, a pepper ball.

Additional [footage](https://twitter.com/45thabsurdist/status/1285498471521239040) shows a car with an explosive projectile fizzling underneath it. Protesters rally to put it out, preventing further damage.

### Federal officers use flashbangs, tear gas and impact munitions to push protesters a third time | 2020-07-22

In the final push of the night, federal officers once again used flashbangs, tear gas and less-lethal projectiles to push protesters down Main Street, out of Chapman and Lownsdale Squares. Protesters eventually returned to the squares, to find officers had destroyed much of the Riot Ribs medical tent, flipping tables and pepper-spraying supplies.

Footage [here](https://twitter.com/defendpdx/status/1285866491275931649) shows officers charging at the crowd, at which point a protester launched a firework. Officers then continued to deploy riot control munitions.

The officers appear to have initially exited the US District Courthouse because protesters were tearing at the building's plywood barricade.

### Federal officers use excessive force to push protesters | 2020-07-22

After protesters fire flares and roman candles across the US District Courthouse fence, small fires begin in the courtyard. In addition, protesters tear a small breach in the fence.

Federal officers deploy tear gas, flashbangs and impact munitions in massive quantities at protesters separated from them by a fence.

As officers and protesters are separated by a fence, there is little to suggest protesters pose an immediate physical threat to officers at any point.

These events occurred shortly before midnight on the night of July 22nd.

Two individuals who attended protests in Portland on July 22nd have been hospitalized for injuries sustained from less lethal rounds used by federal officers near 3rd and Madison.

One protester was shot in the head just below his helmet. A medic who attended him on site says he lost consciousness repeatedly on the way to the hospital. A CT scan revealed metal shrapnel in his head. The protester is now home and is expected to make a full recovery.

The other protester was shot repeatedly in the abdomen. One round pierced through his skin, fat and a first layer of muscle on his back. A trauma surgeon investigated and found that the round had not pierced the protester's abdominal cavity.

Around 4 AM, just hours after a U.S. District Judge blocked federal officers from harming press, a clearly marked member of the press stands at a gap between pieces of District Courthouse fencing. She appears to be filming officers. Several shots are fired and the impact can be seen as they ricochet off her arm. The filmer alleges that at least one projectile struck her in the face.

### Federal officers respond to breach in fence with tear gas | 2020-07-24

After protesters manage to create a small breach in the fence surrounding the U.S. District Courthouse around 1:45 AM, federal officers emerge to push protesters back using tear gas, pepper balls and flashbangs. Officers pushed protesters down the street before protesters were able to reform a shield wall and slowly push officers back toward the courthouse. Footage shows a considerable amount of munitions used and protesters suffering from negative effects of prolonged tear gas exposure, like [here](https://twitter.com/hungrybowtie/status/1286588583067807745)

### Federal officers fire tear gas, flashbangs and pepper balls at crowd | 2020-07-24

Around 11:30 pm on the night of July 24th, federal officers emerged from the US District Courthouse in response to several protester actions: [protesters shaking the fence](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1286905515809705988), protesters launching fireworks and trash, and [protesters with a power saw attempting to breach the fence](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1286911312065253376).

Federal response was to engage the more peaceful side of the crowd, where [Moms Against Police Brutality were protesting](https://twitter.com/PDocumentarians/status/1286915796795396097), then to move over and engage the protesters who had been throwing objects and attempting to breach the fence. Federal officers used excessive force, especially against non-aggressive protesters.

In addition, at least one journalist is struck by a flashbang, seen [here](https://twitter.com/tuckwoodstock/status/1286909282579959810). Officers also used pepper spray or mace through the fence, seen [here](https://twitter.com/DjMontecito/status/1286911093063860225).

### Officers fire tear gas at protesters | 2020-07-29

After shooting pepper balls at protesters from within the courthouse, federal officers emerged from the Justice Center around 11:30 PM to fire tear gas and impact munitions at protesters. Justification for this incident is unclear.

In addition to tear gas canisters, one officer deployed gas using a handheld smoke/fog machine; it is unclear if it was spraying fog or had been modified to use a chemical agent like tear gas. Footage can be seen [here](https://twitter.com/dougbrown8/status/1288727075197657088), [here](https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/status/1288726848998801408), [here](https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/status/1288731149351567360), [here](https://twitter.com/greg_doucette/status/1288876179651547139) and [here](https://twitter.com/greg_doucette/status/1288873806317199360).

A journalist was allegedly hit in the foot with a tear gas canister during the incident, seen [here](https://twitter.com/hungrybowtie/status/1288725286423412736).

Shortly after, officers returned inside the courthouse.

### Police make violent mass arrests | 2020-10-10

15 minutes into a protest near the Blazers Boys and Girls Club, police violently arrest protesters en masse, tackling some protesters and deploying mace against others. Police also ripped umbrellas away from protesters, destroying them. Police had not declared an unlawful assembly, although police had allegedly issued a single warning to protesters to stay off the streets. Several journalists were shoved by police and forced to disperse, in clear violation of the recently renewed TRO exempting members of the press from dispersal orders.

In a press release posted after the fact, police alleged that the protesters were blocking traffic and wearing all black, which would be difficult for motorists to see. As a result, Portland police said, they arrested protesters out of concern for their safety.

Police later released charges, calling the arrests "targeted;" a journalist spoke with a Portland Police spokesperson who defined targeted arrests means "those committing a crime." 26 protesters were arrested; all were charged with interfering with a police officer and with disorderly conduct. Some others were charged with resisting arrest, attempted escape, and possession of a concealed weapon.

### Police escalate conflict with tear gas | 2020-12-31

After a protracted exchange between protesters and police, police, along with DHS agents and Multinomah County Sheriff's Deputies, deployed tear gas against protesters. The tear gas is in direct violation of a PPB ban on tear gas, though likely other departments were brought in to deploy the tear gas itself.

Leading up to this exchange, protesters had thrown paint, fireworks and other small projectiles at police. Additionally, protesters had smashed the windows of several storefronts. In response, police fired smoke grenades, pepper spray, and impact munitions (believed to be pepper balls) at protesters.

An independent photographer was at one point struck in the foot with a tear gas canister, and another journalist was shoved to the ground.
