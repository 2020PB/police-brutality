### Federal officers retaliate to protesters with tear gas, flashbangs and impact munitions | July 21st

After a small group of protesters damaged the plywood barricade on the Justice Center doors around 12:30 AM PST, federal agents emerged from the Justice Center and deployed a variety of riot control munitions against all protesters for a period lasting about half an hour. These munitions include tear gas, flashbangs and unknown less-lethal projectiles.

Prior to emerging, officers dropped a tear gas canister out of a window in the barricade, seen [here](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1285465270685859841).

One reporter [states](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1285465270685859841) he was shoved by an officer, but does not have any supporting footage.

[This footage](https://twitter.com/MrOlmos/status/1285480573981491203) from reporter Sergio Olmos shows officers grabbing protesters who are passively resisting and brandishing batons at others. This footage also shows a protester using a leafblower to redirect tear gas.

[This footage](https://twitter.com/defendpdx/status/1285481849372831749) shows officers throwing explosives at a protester attempting to collect garbage from the street.

It appears that protesters did damage part of the plywood barricade around the Justice Center doors, seen [here](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1285482389628583936).

An [image](https://twitter.com/ProudBulba/status/1285671820637732867) from a protester shows a wound received allegedly at this protest. The protester also displays the projectile that hit her, a pepper ball.

Additional [footage](https://twitter.com/45thabsurdist/status/1285498471521239040) shows a car with an explosive projectile fizzling underneath it. Protesters rally to put it out, preventing further damage.

### Federal officers use flashbangs, tear gas and impact munitions to push protesters a third time | July 22nd

In the final push of the night, federal officers once again used flashbangs, tear gas and less-lethal projectiles to push protesters out of the park. Protesters eventually retook the park, to find officers had destroyed much of the Riot Ribs medical tent, flipping tables and pepper-spraying supplies.

Footage [here](https://twitter.com/defendpdx/status/1285866491275931649) shows officers charging at the crowd, at which point a protester launched a firework. Officers then continued to deploy riot control munitions.

The officers appear to have exited the building initially because protesters were tearing at the building's plywood barricade.

### Federal officers use excessive force to push protesters | July 22nd

After protesters fire flares and roman candles across the fence, small fires begin in the courtyard. In addition, protesters tear a small breach in the fence.

Federal officers deploy tear gas, flashbangs and impact munitions in massive quantities at protesters separated from them by a fence.

As officers and protesters are separated by a fence, there is little to suggest protesters pose an immediate physical threat to officers at any point.

These events occurred shortly before midnight on the night of July 22nd.

Two individuals who attended protests in Portland on July 22nd have been hospitalized for injuries sustained from less lethal rounds used by federal officers.

### Federal officer fire second round of tear gas | July 24th

Around 1:15 AM on July 24th, federal officers declared an unlawful assembly and began pushing protesters north from the Justice Center using tear gas and impact munitions, allegedly pepper balls. The justification for the unlawful assembly declaration appears to be fireworks and a second small trash fire.

Around 4 AM, just hours after a U.S. District Judge blocked federal officers from harming press, a clearly marked member of the press stands at a gap between pieces of fencing. She appears to be filming officers. Several shots are fired and the impact can be seen as they ricochet off her arm. The filmer alleges that at least one projectile struck her in the face.

### Federal officers fire tear gas, flashbangs and pepper balls at crowd | July 24th

Around 11:30 pm on the night of July 24th, federal officers emerged from the Justice Center in response to several protester actions: [protesters shaking the fence](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1286905515809705988), protesters launching fireworks and trash, and [protesters with a power saw attempting to breach the fence](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1286911312065253376).

Federal response was to engage the more peaceful side of the crowd, where [Moms Against Police Brutality were protesting](https://twitter.com/PDocumentarians/status/1286915796795396097), then to move over and engage the protesters who had been throwing objects and attempting to breach the fence. Federal officers used excessive force, especially against non-aggressive protesters.

In addition, at least one journalist is struck by a flashbang, seen [here](https://twitter.com/tuckwoodstock/status/1286909282579959810). Officers also used pepper spray or mace through the fence, seen [here](https://twitter.com/DjMontecito/status/1286911093063860225).
