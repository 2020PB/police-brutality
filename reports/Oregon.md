### Federal officers retaliate to protestors with tear gas, flashbangs and impact munitions | July 21st

After a small group of protestors damaged the plywood barricade on the Justice Center doors around 12:30 AM PST, federal agents emerged from the Justice Center and deployed a variety of riot control munitions against all protestors for a period lasting about half an hour. These munitions include tear gas, flashbangs and unknown less-lethal projectiles.

Prior to emerging, officers dropped a tear gas canister out of a window in the barricade, seen [here](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1285465270685859841).

One reporter [states](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1285465270685859841) he was shoved by an officer, but does not have any supporting footage.

[This footage](https://twitter.com/MrOlmos/status/1285480573981491203) from reporter Sergio Olmos shows officers grabbing protestors who are passively resisting and brandishing batons at others. This footage also shows a protestor using a leafblower to redirect tear gas.

[This footage](https://twitter.com/defendpdx/status/1285481849372831749) shows officers throwing explosives at a protestor attempting to collect garbage from the street.

It appears that protestors did damage part of the plywood barricade around the Justice Center doors, seen [here](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1285482389628583936).

An [image](https://twitter.com/ProudBulba/status/1285671820637732867) from a protestor shows a wound received allegedly at this protest. The protestor also displays the projectile that hit her, a pepper ball.

Additional [footage](https://twitter.com/45thabsurdist/status/1285498471521239040) shows a car with an explosive projectile fizzling underneath it. Protestors rally to put it out, preventing further damage.

### Federal officers use flashbangs, tear gas and impact munitions to push protestors a third time | July 22nd

In the final push of the night, federal officers once again used flashbangs, tear gas and less-lethal projectiles to push protestors out of the park. Protestors eventually retook the park, to find officers had destroyed much of the Riot Ribs medical tent, flipping tables and pepper-spraying supplies.

Footage [here](https://twitter.com/defendpdx/status/1285866491275931649) shows officers charging at the crowd, at which point a protestor launched a firework. Officers then continued to deploy riot control munitions.

The officers appear to have exited the building initially because protestors were tearing at the building's plywood barricade.

### Federal officers use excessive force to push protestors | July 22nd

After protestors fire flares and roman candles across the fence, small fires begin in the courtyard. In addition, protestors tear a small breach in the fence.

Federal officers deploy tear gas, flashbangs and impact munitions in massive quantities at protestors separated from them by a fence.

As officers and protestors are separated by a fence, there is little to suggest protestors pose an immediate physical threat to officers at any point.

These events occurred shortly before midnight on the night of July 22nd.

### Federal officers respond to breach in fence with tear gas | July 24th

After protestors manage to create a small breach in the fence surrounding the Justice Center around 1:45 AM, federal officers emerge to push protestors back using tear gas, pepper balls and flashbangs. Officers pushed protestors down the street before protestors were able to reform a shield wall and slowly push officers back towards the Justice Center. Footage shows a considerable amount of munitions used and protestors suffering from negative effects of prolonged tear gas exposure, like [here](https://twitter.com/hungrybowtie/status/1286588583067807745)

### Federal officers fire tear gas, flashbangs and pepper balls at crowd | July 24th

Around 11:30 pm on the night of July 24th, federal officers emerged from the Justice Center in response to several protestor actions: [protestors shaking the fence](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1286905515809705988), protestors launching fireworks and trash, and [protestors with a power saw attempting to breach the fence](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1286911312065253376).

Federal response was to engage the more peaceful side of the crowd, where [Moms Against Police Brutality were protesting](https://twitter.com/PDocumentarians/status/1286915796795396097), then to move over and engage the protestors who had been throwing objects and attempting to breach the fence. Federal officers used excessive force, especially against non-aggressive protestors.

In addition, at least one journalist is struck by a flashbang, seen [here](https://twitter.com/tuckwoodstock/status/1286909282579959810). Officers also used pepper spray or mace through the fence, seen [here](https://twitter.com/DjMontecito/status/1286911093063860225).
