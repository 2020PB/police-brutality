Footage shows police pushing protestors east under direction of a dispersal order. After a scuffle with police around 1:30, the filmer recognizes an officer.

Then for several minutes, police argue with him about his presence and whether he as a journalist is allowed on the scene.

At 5:20, the filmer asks an officer for his number. The officer shows the number on his helmet and the filmer then identifies him. The officer then ignores him. At 6:15, a second officer approaches. He and the recognized officer then arrest the journalist.

He has allegedly been charged with assault of a police officer, interference with a police officer, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. A screenshot of his charges is included in the 4th link.

### Federal officers retaliate to protestors with tear gas, flashbangs and impact munitions | July 21st

After a small group of protestors damaged the plywood barricade on the Justice Center doors around 12:30 AM PST, federal agents emerged from the Justice Center and deployed a variety of riot control munitions against all protestors for a period lasting about half an hour. These munitions include tear gas, flashbangs and unknown less-lethal projectiles.

Prior to emerging, officers dropped a tear gas canister out of a window in the barricade, seen [here](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1285465270685859841).

One reporter [states](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1285465270685859841) he was shoved by an officer, but does not have any supporting footage.

[This footage](https://twitter.com/MrOlmos/status/1285480573981491203) from reporter Sergio Olmos shows officers grabbing protestors who are passively resisting and brandishing batons at others. This footage also shows a protestor using a leafblower to redirect tear gas.

[This footage](https://twitter.com/defendpdx/status/1285481849372831749) shows officers throwing explosives at a protestor attempting to collect garbage from the street.

It appears that protestors did damage part of the plywood barricade around the Justice Center doors, seen [here](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1285482389628583936).

An [image](https://twitter.com/ProudBulba/status/1285671820637732867) from a protestor shows a wound received allegedly at this protest. The protestor also displays the projectile that hit her, a pepper ball.

Additional [footage](https://twitter.com/45thabsurdist/status/1285498471521239040) shows a car with an explosive projectile fizzling underneath it. Protestors rally to put it out, preventing further damage.

### Federal officers use flashbangs, tear gas and impact munitions to push protestors a third time | July 22nd

In the final push of the night, federal officers once again used flashbangs, tear gas and less-lethal projectiles to push protestors out of the park. Protestors eventually retook the park, to find officers had destroyed much of the Riot Ribs medical tent, flipping tables and pepper-spraying supplies.

Footage [here](https://twitter.com/defendpdx/status/1285866491275931649) shows officers charging at the crowd, at which point a protestor launched a firework. Officers then continued to deploy riot control munitions.

The officers appear to have exited the building initially because protestors were tearing at the building's plywood barricade.

### Federal officers use excessive force to push protestors | July 22nd

After protestors fire flares and roman candles across the fence, small fires begin in the courtyard. In addition, protestors tear a small breach in the fence.

Federal officers deploy tear gas, flashbangs and impact munitions in massive quantities at protestors separated from them by a fence.

As officers and protestors are separated by a fence, there is little to suggest protestors pose an immediate physical threat to officers at any point.

These events occurred shortly before midnight on the night of July 22nd.

Two individuals who attended protests in Portland on July 22nd have been hospitalized for injuries sustained from less lethal rounds used by federal officers.

### Federal officer fire second round of tear gas | July 24th

Around 1:15 AM on July 24th, federal officers declared an unlawful assembly and began pushing protestors north from the Justice Center using tear gas and impact munitions, allegedly pepper balls. The justification for the unlawful assembly declaration appears to be fireworks and a second small trash fire.

### Journalist shot, allegedly in the face | July 24th

Around 4 AM, just hours after a U.S. District Judge blocked federal officers from harming press, a clearly marked member of the press stands at a gap between pieces of fencing. She appears to be filming officers. Several shots are fired and the impact can be seen as they ricochet off her arm. The filmer alleges that at least one projectile struck her in the face.

### Federal officers fire tear gas, flashbangs and pepper balls at crowd | July 24th

Around 11:30 pm on the night of July 24th, federal officers emerged from the Justice Center in response to several protestor actions: [protestors shaking the fence](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1286905515809705988), protestors launching fireworks and trash, and [protestors with a power saw attempting to breach the fence](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1286911312065253376).

Federal response was to engage the more peaceful side of the crowd, where [Moms Against Police Brutality were protesting](https://twitter.com/PDocumentarians/status/1286915796795396097), then to move over and engage the protestors who had been throwing objects and attempting to breach the fence. Federal officers used excessive force, especially against non-aggressive protestors.

In addition, at least one journalist is struck by a flashbang, seen [here](https://twitter.com/tuckwoodstock/status/1286909282579959810). Officers also used pepper spray or mace through the fence, seen [here](https://twitter.com/DjMontecito/status/1286911093063860225).
