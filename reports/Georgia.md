### Police fire tear gas at peaceful protest | 2020-06-01

During a peaceful protest on Broad Street near University of Georgia (UGA), police began firing tear gas indiscriminately and with excess.

One protester can be seen with a firework, similar to a Roman candle, firing from considerable distance and into the air.

Police fired a sustained barrage of tear gas for approximately one minute while protesters retreated.

Later footage shows police continuing to fire tear gas down the street as students walk past with their hands up, obeying police orders.

### Sheriff scuffles with protester over "F\*ck Trump" sign | 2020-06-03

Lowndes County sheriff, Ashley Paulk, confiscated a "F\*ck Trump" sign from a protester, citing it as "evidence" for a crime not stated, in itself a violation of 1st Amendment rights. The woman attempted to grab the sign back and the sheriff choked her in response, before protesters separated the two.

In a later statement, the sheriff said he would continue to charge protesters carrying posters with profanity with misdemeanor disorderly conduct, in violation of Supreme Court case [Cohen v. California](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7398433541275578772&q=cohen+v.+california&hl=en&as_sdt=3,39) which ruled a man wearing a "Fuck the Draft" jacket could not be convicted for disturbing the peace. In addition, a [Georgia supreme court case](https://law.justia.com/cases/georgia/supreme-court/2017/s17a1040.html) cleared a man charged with disorderly conduct for raising his middle finger in a church. The sheriff cited a Georgia law allowing misdemeanor charges for profanity in the presence of an individual under 14 years of age.

In the background of the second clip, a police cruiser marked "Valdosta" can be seen, establishing the location.

### Sheriff arrests woman for sign containing profanity | 2020-06-04

In a continuation of events from June 3rd (ga-valdosta-1), sheriff Ashley Paulk arrested a woman carrying a sign suggestive of a "lewd act" between Paulk and Donald Trump, fulfilling his threat to arrest protesters carrying signs containing profanity. He cited a Georgia law allowing misdemeanor charges for profanity in the presence of an individual under 14 years of age, despite [U.S. Supreme Court cases](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7398433541275578772&q=cohen+v.+california&hl=en&as_sdt=3,39) and [Georgia Supreme Court cases](https://law.justia.com/cases/georgia/supreme-court/2017/s17a1040.html) exonerating individuals charged with similar crimes.
