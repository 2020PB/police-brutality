### Beverly Hills police use LRAD (sound cannon) at protest | June 26th

During a peaceful protest in Beverly Hills, police used the dispersal function of a LRAD (or sound cannon) on protestors. Footage is pointed at the ground, but audio shows individuals arguing. The LRAD's characteristic dispersal signal is used twice, each time without warning and for about 30 seconds. In addition, a photojournalist at the scene confirms the LRAD was used.

Due to its high risk of permanent injury, indiscriminate damage, and insufficient testing surrounding long-terms effects, the use of the LRAD dispersal function is considered to be police brutality in and of itself.

## Gustine

### Protesters attacked; police shake hands of attackers; tell protesters to wait in patrol cars | June 28th

About twenty anti-BLM protesters (holding a thin blue line flag and affiliated with California Valley Patriots (CVP)) were holding a rally in Gustine California (at the corner of Grove Avenue and 5th Street). A group of around 3 young people decided to hold an impromptu counter-protest, and parked across the street from the CVP protesters. CVP protesters came across the street and began shouting at the counter-protesters. Some time later, video shows one counter-protester on the ground, on the CVP proesters' side of the street, being beaten by CVP protesters. Another counter-protester is trying to intervene but being physically restrained by CVP protesters; a third is filming the incident as CVP protesters heckle her. Photos taken after the incident show at least two of the protesters badly beaten. Each side says the other started the altercation.

Police arrived shortly thereafter. They told the counter-protesters to wait in police cars (allegedly for their own protection); the counter-protesters say they were kept in police cars for nearly an hour. The CVP protesters were not put into police cars. One counter-protester says that counter-protesters tried to leave multiple times, but were told that they were not free to go. Police can be seen shaking the hand of one of the CVP protesters; counter-protesters claim police were somewhat dismissive of their allegations of assault against the CVP protesters. No arrests were made, but a report concerning the incident has been referred to the DA.

### Police arrest protesters en masse and detain them in poor conditions | June 1st

Police arrested protesters en masse in downtown Los Angeles. Protesters hands were zip tied excessively tightly behind their backs and they were loaded onto buses and driven around the city. Some were taken to a temporary field jail at UCLA's Jackie Robinson stadium; UCLA claims it "failed to stop" LAPD from using the stadium as a "staging area," but was not told about the field jail until after the fact. Arestees were detained for long periods, still in excessively tight zip ties. Social distancing procedures were not observed.

Many protesters allege that conditions in the makeshift jails were poor -- detainees denied medical attention and permission to use the restroom, for instance -- and that they were released, many with dead phones, in unfamiliar places in the middle of the night with no way to get home. Two arrestees allege that police prevented them from leaving before the curfew went into effect, then arrested them for violating the curfew. One arrestee alleges that she was twice threatened with guns, that she was sexually assaulted by police, and that police mocked detainees having panic attacks. Police also allegedly arrested at least one homeless person (to whom the curfew was not supposed to apply) for a curfew violation.

A lawsuit has been filed in connection with these and other abuses by the National Lawyers' Guild; a separate lawsuit has been filed by one of the arrestees. (See also incidents ca-losangeles-32 (near-identical behavior the following day) and ca-santamonica-2 (similar behavior in Santa Monica).)

### Police arrest protesters en masse and detain them in poor conditions | June 2nd

Police arrested protesters en masse near the home of LA mayor Eric Garcetti and in other parts of the city, zip tied their hands, and held them for extended periods without appropriate social distancing. At least one arrestee alleges that protesters were given explicit permission to remain past the curfew, then arrested for being out after curfew. Many arrestees say they were released in the middle of the night, without transportation home, in unfamiliar parts of the city.

Several arrestees describe police sexually harassing/assaulting them; other arrestees corroborate these accounts. Two arrestees report that processing of arrestees on their bus was delayed because they requested medical attention and other improvements in their conditions, which would constitute first-amendment-protected speech. Four other arrestees report that processing of arrestees on their bus was delayed because some arrestees removed unsafely-tight zip ties using a lighter. All arrestees who have shared accounts mention officers behaving in a mocking, condescending, and unprofessional manner. One arrestee recalls asking officers to turn on bodycams, and officers refusing to do so. If true, this would be a clear violation of LAPD policy. One arrestee allegedly should have been exempt from the curfew as they were returning home from work.

A lawsuit has been filed in connection with these and other abuses by the National Lawyers' Guild. (See also incidents ca-losangeles-19 (near-identical behavior the previous day) and ca-santamonica-2 (similar behavior in Santa Monica).)

This is in the wake of a Mayoral ordinance for the LAPD to restrict their use of kinetic projectiles, particularly rubber bullets, and the injury is more consistent with direct, close range fire than proper use.

### Police make violent arrests, including ripping a protestor out of his wheelchair and inducing an asthma attack | July 15th

Footage shows a scuffle as police arrest protestors. A protestor in a wheelchair pushes police away from him. Police then knock him backwards out of his chair. The man attempts to pull himself away. Police close in. The protestor grabs the officer's baton, but multiple officers restrain him and take his wheelchair away. One officer drags the chair and appears to knock a wheel loose, which then falls off after the officer scuffles with another protestor. The protestor who was in the wheelchair passively resists by locking his arms while police arrest him. Body cam footage released by the LAPD shows the man in the wheelchair striking an officer in the face during a physical altercation between the protestor and the officer. Notably, the LAPD footage fails to show the lead up to the protestor in the wheelchair slapping the officer.

Footage from instagram (second link, fourth in list) shows a man suffering an asthma attack after allegedly being struck in the neck with a baton. The last video in the instagram post appears to show the man on a gurney receiving medical attention. Other videos in the post show police shoving protestors with their hands and with batons. The poster also alleges that police held a woman in a chokehold.

Additional [footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCqPuekHCyg/) shows an officer striking a protestor with a baton as the protestor tries to help the man in the wheelchair.

Another [update](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCxPb28hRdN/) states all charges against him were dropped.\

### Police arrest protesters en masse, confine them for long periods, and improperly zip tie them | May 31st

On May 31st, police arrested numerous protesters for curfew violations. These protesters were zip tied and held for long periods, in tight quarters which did not permit social distancing, then released late at night with no way to get home. At least one detainee alleges that detainees were denied medical care and permission to use the restroom.

Zip ties were put on too tight. Police attempted to remove zip ties with a long knife (which is not the appropriate tool). This led to multiple protesters being injured, including one who required 21 stitches; it seems unlikely that the knife was appropriately sterilized between uses, raising the possibility of bloodborne pathogen transmission.

(See also incidents ca-losangeles-19 and ca-losangeles-32 (similar behavior in Los Angeles). Note that the final link incorrectly states that the incident it describes was perpetrated by LAPD; in fact, as several commenters pointed out, it was perpetrated by Santa Monica PD, though there are allegations of similar conduct by the LAPD.)

### Police fatally shoot unarmed 22 year old | June 1st

Police in northern California fatally shot an unarmed 22-year-old who was on his knees with his hands up outside a Walgreens store while responding to a call of alleged looting, officials said... An officer in the city of Vallejo was inside his car when he shot Sean Monterrosa on Monday night amid local and national protests against police brutality. Police said an officer mistakenly believed Monterrosa had a gun, but later determined he had a hammer in his pocket... 'When confronted by the police, he dropped to his knees and surrendered, and they fired at him,' said Melissa Nold, a Vallejo civil rights attorney representing Monterrosa’s family.

Six officers fired 55 bullets in 3.5 seconds; police investigation determined this use of force 'reasonable.'

Vallejo PD has posted composite video containing body cam footage, radio chatter with Dispatch and prior footage of Walgreen's security cameras being destroyed. This footage shows a car with alleged looters peeling out of the Walgreens as police arrive; this car strikes an unmarked police vehicle and continues. Police open the doors of their unmarked van and fire on Monterrosa immediately and without warning. They state that they believed Monterrosa was armed, thought it turned out to be only a hammer.

### Armored law enforcement vehicle threatens protestors, deploys tear gas on highway | June 1st

In this video, an armored law enforcement vehicle tells protestors blocking a highway to disperse over megaphone. It sounds like the operator is saying "if you do not move, you will be dead," but video later released by the police department seems to show that the operator instead said "if you do not move, you will be gassed." The protesters do not move; the officers deploy tear gas, coating the highway in dense, opaque clouds of blinding fog. Vehicles are seen waiting to continue on their way; it is unclear whether these vehicles attempted to navigate the clouds of tear gas. (Note: Jalopnik reports that this happened on June 2; however, protests consistent with the video were only reported on June 1, and other sources place the video on June 1.)

### Police arrest man using excessive force, dogs | June 1st

Police threw tear gas at protesters blocking a roadway in an effort to disperse them. One protester, Joseph Malott, allegedly threw a tear gas canister back at police. Police arrested him for (per Mercury News) “assaulting a police officer with a deadly weapon.” During the arrest, Malott was bitten and scratched repeatedly by a police dog, leaving bite marks and scratches all over his back and a wound on his leg which required 10 stitches. During the arrest, he says he was slammed against a fence then thrown to the ground, and recalls thinking “when are they going to take the dogs off me?”
