### Couple pepper-sprayed; woman knocked unconscious; man blinded by rubber bullet | June 2nd

A couple states that they attended a peaceful protest in the early afternoon with their dog. After seeing police allegedly beat a trumpeter, they took their dog home and returned.

Around 9pm, one victim, Sean, states that police began pepper-spraying without warning. He states that police knocked his partner, Sydney, to the pavement and she fell unconscious. Sean dragged her away to a nearby park. Shortly after she awoke, a rubber bullet struck Sean in the face.

After arriving at the hospital, Sean was told he would be permanently blind, but had been spared broken bones or death by a matter of inches.

### Florissant officer hits man with unmarked police vehicle | June 2nd

The officer has since been fired.
