### Multiple cops pin man to ground while repeatedly punching him | June 1st

An image shows multiple wounds from a less lethal round, one of which has broken the skin. The nature of the wound is consistent with misuse - specifically, firing at short range.

The poster states that the individual is her boyfriend. She alleges he was standing with his hands up.




https://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoSprings/comments/gu9p4b/protest_aftermath_my_boyfriend_was_shot_standing/



Police officers tell a man standing in an intersection to get on the ground then shoot him (apparently with rubber bullets). He falls to the ground. He attempts to get up; an officer tackles him. At least 5 cops pin him down. Several of them punch him repeatedly even though he appears to not be resisting. At one point a bystander says "yeah, punch him again -- I'm filming you!" An officer punches the man again.

Journalist Alex Burness was hit by some sort of projectile. Later in the night, an officer ordered Burness to turn around and walk in the opposite direction (toward a large cloud of tear gas).

### Protestor struck in head at short range with explosive projectile | (Believed to be) June 5th

Footage shows protestors walking away from police. An officer fires an explosive projectile at the ground, which then ricochets and strikes protestor in head. Protestor crumples to the ground. Title on Reddit states that the protestor suffered permanent hearing loss, but this has not been verified.

It should be noted that these rounds are intended to be shot at the ground as the officer did. However, the proximity of the shot to protestors severely increased the risk of injury, as seen here.

Footage was first posted on reddit.com/r/protest on June 5th.

### Police use excessive force to clear protestor tent encampment | July 1st

The first clip is a livestream from the night of the dispersal. Police standoff begins around 1:28:00. Police begin by snatching and grabbing protestors to arrest. Then a scuffle breaks out, the camera pans to show an officer striking protestors with his baton. Another officer approaches and pepper-sprays protestors. A third officer fires a riot gun, containing either pepper balls or paintballs, at protestors. Police then tear gas the area while protestors flee. At 1:34:00, police arrest a medic. At 1:38:00, police advance towards the protestors again, pushing them off the sidewalk to the far side of the street. A shot can be heard, then a scream. The camera pans to show a scuffle between police and protestors. Police then use pepper-spray and riot rounds to force protestors back. A protestor is arrested. The arrest takes several minutes and it appears that police kneel on the woman's neck while making the arrest. At 1:51:00, one officer is shown without a badge number or body cam. The filmer then looks at several other officers.

The third link shows another angle on the incident at 1:28:00.

The fourth link shows another angle on the incident at 1:38:00. In addition, the caption states that police were using pepper balls.
