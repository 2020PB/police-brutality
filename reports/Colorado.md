### Multiple cops pin man to ground while repeatedly punching him | June 1st

Police officers tell a man standing in an intersection to get on the ground then shoot him (apparently with rubber bullets). He falls to the ground. He attempts to get up; an officer tackles him. At least 5 cops pin him down. Several of them punch him repeatedly even though he appears to not be resisting. At one point a bystander says "yeah, punch him again -- I'm filming you!" An officer punches the man again.

### Protestor struck in head at short range with explosive projectile | (Believed to be) June 6th

Footage shows protestors walking away from police. An officer fires an explosive projectile at the ground, which then ricochets and strikes protestor in head. Protestor crumples to the ground. Title on Reddit states that the protestor suffered permanent hearing loss, but this has not been verified.

It should be noted that these rounds are intended to be shot at the ground as the officer did. However, the proximity of the shot to protestors severely increased the risk of injury, as seen here.

Footage was first posted on reddit.com/r/protest on June 6th.
