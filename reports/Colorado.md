### Multiple cops pin man to ground while repeatedly punching him | 2020-06-01

Police officers tell a man standing in an intersection to get on the ground then shoot him (apparently with rubber bullets). He falls to the ground. He attempts to get up; an officer tackles him. At least 5 cops pin him down. Several of them punch him repeatedly even though he appears to not be resisting. At one point a bystander says "yeah, punch him again -- I'm filming you!" An officer punches the man again.

### Journalist injured by tear gas, less-than-lethal round | 2020-05-31

Journalist Alex Burness was hit by some sort of projectile. Later in the night, an officer ordered Burness to turn around and walk in the opposite direction (toward a large cloud of tear gas). He shouted "press," but the officer raised his weapon, forcing Burness (and an associate in a neon "press" vest) to walk into the tear gas. Journalist Dave Sachs claims something similar happened to him -- he showed his press pass to police but they shoved him into tear gas.

Burness states that he was gassed on Clarkson st near the Good Times restaurant (808 E Colfax).

### Police use excessive force to clear protester tent encampment | 2020-07-01

The first clip is a livestream from the night of the dispersal at Civic Center Park. Police standoff begins around 1:28:00. Police begin by snatching and grabbing protesters to arrest. Then a scuffle breaks out, the camera pans to show an officer striking protesters with his baton. Another officer approaches and pepper-sprays protesters. A third officer fires a riot gun, containing either pepper balls or paintballs, at protesters. Police then tear gas the area while protesters flee. At 1:34:00, police arrest a medic. At 1:38:00, police advance towards the protesters again, pushing them off the sidewalk to the far side of the street. A shot can be heard, then a scream. The camera pans to show a scuffle between police and protesters. Police then use pepper-spray and riot rounds to force protesters back. A protester is arrested. The arrest takes several minutes and it appears that police kneel on the woman's neck while making the arrest. At 1:51:00, one officer is shown without a badge number or body cam. The filmer then looks at several other officers.

The third link shows another angle on the incident at 1:28:00.

### Denver police tackle, arrest, and sexually assault protester | 2020-07-29

At a protest on July 29th, a protester was tackled by police. Police claim the man resisted arrest and attempted to disarm an officer. The protester denies these allegations, saying he was rattling a chain link fence and no more.

After tackling the protester, officers punched him and struck him with a baton. One officer can be seen jabbing the protester in the rear end with a baton. The protester states he was sexually assault, with the officer shoving the baton into his rectum. That night, he was given a rape kit and examined for signs of sexual assault. Records from a specialist two weeks later diagnosed the protester with rectal and anal hemorrhage, as well as hemorrhoids.

The protester will go to court on September 28th to fight the charge of disarming a police officer.
