### Police laugh and joke when they think their body cams are off | 2020-05-31

Body cam video released by Fort Lauderdale PD on Youtube shows police laughing and joking after shooting protesters with rubber bullets and tear gas. They are speaking candidly to one another because they mistakenly believe their cams are in "standby" mode and not recording. Policing experts who reviewed the footage say that the behavior is unprofessional and that the officers felt "comfortable about talking about turning the camera off." At 2:55, a cop can be heard saying "if you need it, give me a target." The Miami Herald quotes a retired Lieutenant Colonel as commenting, "If you're not seeing a threat, why are you asking for a threat? That would almost lead you to believe that they were indiscriminately firing."

### Police deployed two rounds of tear gas against peaceful protesters | 2020-06-27

A group of protesters blocked highway 395 in Miami. Police deployed tear gas at 9:00 pm and 9:09 PM to clear protesters.

In the 9:00 PM round, the filmer can be heard saying, "They're smoke bombs. No, they're not. They're tear gas." The filmer then flees with other protesters. Footage then shows a woman screaming and in sufficient pain that another protester is needed to carry her away quickly.

Around 9:09 PM, protesters gathered on the highway on-ramp. Police then, without warning, fired another round of tear gas, forcing protesters to flee. The caption states multiple protesters were shot with rubber bullets, but no shots can be heard in this footage.

### Police officer grabs arrestee's breast; police violently arrest protester | 2020-07-01

Footage shows police arresting a woman. A man who walked nearby with his hands up is thrown to the ground by two officers and arrested.

Additional footage shows an officer grabbing the breast of the woman arrested. It should be noted that police use an "open hand" frisking technique to check along the breasts during an arrest. However the officer does not appear to be using an open hand and appears to be grabbing the woman, rather than frisking her. While having a male officer frisk a female protester without warning is a point of controversy, this incident appears to be outside police guidelines even discounting that fact.
