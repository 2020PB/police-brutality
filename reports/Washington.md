### Protestor targeted days after protest | June 5th

Footage and reports show approximately 30 police officers in 6-7 squad cars arrive to arrest a woman in a car with her 9 year old child.

Officers arrived on the scene brandishing mace, alleging that the woman assaulted two police officers several days prior. She was dragged from her car and the car was towed from her home.

Officers cited a Star Wars meme depicting a Landspeeder with a caption saying, "This machine kills facists," as intent to kill officers.

The woman states she tried to help a friend who was being shot with rubber bullets.

### Woman hit with police projectile resumes breathing after CPR, delivered to hospital | June 7th

Video shows an individual getting hit by a police projectile, falling down, and becoming unresponsive. Medics drag the person away from the police. A medic's first-hand narrative account describes the victim as "a young woman in her 20s." Medics attempt to treat the young woman while police throw flash bang grenades directly into the first aid center where they are gathered. Several times the victim stops responding or breathing but becomes responsive again after CPR. 911 could not send an ambulance. Eventually a civilian transports her by car to an Emergency Dept where she was delivered with a pulse. The person who filmed the incident from his workplace office is an editor at the local alt weekly, The Stranger; he reported in his twitter thread that the people in the office were having trouble breathing from teargas or some other chemical agent.

### Police arrest journalist | July 10th

First person footage from a photojournalist shows the journalist filming a police car while stating that allegedly the officer in the car said that the officer has the photojournalist's address. The journalist repeats these words back, including the exact phrase, "I have your address." The officer then approaches him and arrests him for threatening an officer, alleging that the journalist claimed to have the officer's address.

The second link shows the full series of events. The photojournalist is filming police as they write parking citations. He is using strong language with the officers and harassing them. However he is doing no more than hurling insults and noting names and badge numbers. At 2:00, it can be verified that the officer does say he has the journalist's address. So, in fact, when he is arrested for threatening an officer, he is repeating the officer's words back to him.

Notably, this journalist filmed the arrest of the individual in wa-seattle-27.

The cop then suddenly rushes the cyclist and tackles them off the bicycle. Other cops converge to arrest the cyclist.
