### Protestor targeted days after protest | June 5th

Footage and reports show approximately 30 police officers in 6-7 squad cars arrive to arrest a woman in a car with her 9 year old child.

Officers arrived on the scene brandishing mace, alleging that the woman assaulted two police officers several days prior. She was dragged from her car and the car was towed from her home.

Officers cited a Star Wars meme depicting a Landspeeder with a caption saying, "This machine kills facists," as intent to kill officers.

The woman states she tried to help a friend who was being shot with rubber bullets.

### Police pepper spray protesters who can't move back | June 6th

In a series of videos, we see police asking protesters to move back, but the crowd is too dense for them to do so. Police then start pepper-spraying protesters at the front of the crowd and launch flashbangs into and near the crowd. At 1:30 in the first video, it appears a protester is hit with a projectile. In the subsequent clips, teargas is seen being spread into a group of protesters by police.

### Woman hit with police projectile resumes breathing after CPR, delivered to hospital | June 7th

Video shows an individual getting hit by a police projectile, falling down, and becoming unresponsive. Medics drag the person away from the police. A medic's first-hand narrative account describes the victim as "a young woman in her 20s." Medics attempt to treat the young woman while police throw flash bang grenades directly into the first aid center where they are gathered. Several times the victim stops responding or breathing but becomes responsive again after CPR. 911 could not send an ambulance. Eventually a civilian transports her by car to an Emergency Dept where she was delivered with a pulse. The person who filmed the incident from his workplace office is an editor at the local alt weekly, The Stranger; he reported in his twitter thread that the people in the office were having trouble breathing from teargas or some other chemical agent.
