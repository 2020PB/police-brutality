### Protester arrested after dangling doughnut in front of officers | 2020-07-17

Footage shows a protester dangling a doughnut on a stick in front of a man's face. He asks the man, "Any of you bootlickers want this?" The man replies, "Get that fucking shit out of my face," and an officer shoves the protester. The protester tries to pick his doughnut off the ground, but an officer steps on it. An officer grabs the protester, stating, "It's time for you to go," evidently arresting the protester. Another officer states that the protester "assaulted a lieutenant." This same officer threatens other protesters to back off or they will go to jail. His badge number is covered by a piece of tape. Protesters then follow police to the entrance of a building where the original protester is being cuffed. Protesters and counter-protesters then argue with one another.

The incident appears to be near the county courthouse complex.

### Protester targeted days after protest | 2020-06-05

Footage and reports show approximately 30 police officers in 6-7 squad cars arrive to arrest a woman in a car with her 9 year old child.

Officers arrived on the scene brandishing mace, alleging that the woman assaulted two police officers several days prior. She was dragged from her car and the car was towed from her home.

Officers cited a Star Wars meme depicting a Landspeeder with a caption saying, "This machine kills facists," as intent to kill officers.

The woman states she tried to help a friend who was being shot with rubber bullets.

The woman lives somewhere in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle.

### Woman hit with police projectile resumes breathing after CPR, delivered to hospital | 2020-06-07

Video shows an individual getting hit by a police projectile, falling down, and becoming unresponsive. Medics drag the person away from the police. A medic's first-hand narrative account describes the victim as "a young woman in her 20s." Medics attempt to treat the young woman while police throw flash bang grenades directly into the first aid center where they are gathered. Several times the victim stops responding or breathing but becomes responsive again after CPR. 911 could not send an ambulance. Eventually a civilian transports her by car to an Emergency Dept where she was delivered with a pulse. The person who filmed the incident from his workplace office is an editor at the local alt weekly, The Stranger; he reported in his twitter thread that the people in the office were having trouble breathing from teargas or some other chemical agent.

The incident occurred near 11th and Pine.

### Police arrest journalist | 2020-07-10

First person footage from a photojournalist shows the journalist filming a police car while stating that allegedly the officer in the car said that the officer has the photojournalist's address. The journalist repeats these words back, including the exact phrase, "I have your address." The officer then approaches him and arrests him for threatening an officer, alleging that the journalist claimed to have the officer's address.

The second link shows the full series of events. The photojournalist is filming police as they write parking citations. He is using strong language with the officers and harassing them. However he is doing no more than hurling insults and noting names and badge numbers. At 2:00, it can be verified that the officer does say he has the journalist's address. So, in fact, when he is arrested for threatening an officer, he is repeating the officer's words back to him.

Notably, this journalist filmed the arrest of the individual in wa-seattle-27.

The incident occurred at Jefferson and 5th.

### Officer escalates scuffle by pepper spraying and arresting protester | 2020-11-27

While police are dispersing protesters at E Olive Way and E Denny Way, an officer and an elderly man holding a cane are seen in the street. The officer is pushing the man back across the street and the man is attempting to walk the opposite direction. After the officer pushes the protester to the sidewalk, the officer turns to walk away. The protester then lightly strikes the body-armored officer on the back with his cane; the cane then collapses, suggesting it is a collapsible cane, not capable of striking forcefully. The officer then pepper sprays the protester and tackles him to the ground for arrest.

While it is clear the protester did strike the officer, the question of brutality lies in the force used by the officer: the use of pepper spray and the tackling a man using a cane appear to be disproportionate to the protester's light strike.
