## Bethel

### Man struck by counter-protestor while police look on | June 14th

During a BLM protest in Bethel, Ohio, protestors were met by a substantial counter-protest, which allegedly harrassed and assaulted them. In one particular video, a counter-protestor strikes a BLM protestor on the back of the head and walk away. There are police officers directly in front of and behind the incident. The man tells the officer he just got punched. The officer's response is difficult to hear above the crowd, but he appears to offer little help, instead telling the protestor he is not allowed to demonstrate there (on a public sidewalk).

News report includes footage of counter-protestors using racial slurs, harassing protestors and rip signs out of protestor hands while police look on.

### Police violently disperse crowds, before curfew and allegedly without provocation | May 31st

Police use tear gas to disperse a crowd before curfew. No provocation is mentioned in the news article; a first-hand account posted to facebook claims there was none. The account posted to Facebook claims that no order to disperse was given; local news coverage does not mention any order to disperse being given. Mass arrests were conducted at some point the night of the 31st. The account posted to Facebook claims that police surrounded and trapped protesters before curfew, and beat some protesters.

### Tattoo artist arrested while painting the outside of his shop; police fail to deescalate | May 31st

Jamison Walker, a Cincinnati tattoo artist, with the owner's permission, was painting the outside of the shop where he works after curfew. He alleges that a police officer told him he could finish his work. The Instagram video begins at some later point as several cops approach. They tell Walker (and at least two other persons present) to "get inside." For around 12 seconds, two police officers, Walker, and one other tattoo shop employee are talking simultaneously; Walker told local news he tried to go inside but one officer blocked his path. One officer can be heard to say "I'm giving you a chance, go in," then another can be heard to say "That's exactly what's going to happen -- no -- no no -- inside, go inside, inside -- go inside, there's no debate -- no, you may not." Said officer then begins arresting Walker. Officers shove Walker against a wall and grab his arms; they yell for him to put his hands behind his back. One officer draws a taser and holds it near Walker's shoulder. Meanwhile, one of Walker's colleagues is filming; police scream at her to "get the fuck back -- get back." It's unclear whether she's standing in a doorway or backed up against a wall. Another officer is acting very aggressively and has his taser drawn until the cop next to him taps him on the arm, at which point he holsters his taser and steps back. In total, at least eight police officers are present, of whom at least two draw their tasers, despite facing little to no resistance.

NOTE: While curfews in many cities exempted anyone going to or from work, Cincinnati's exempted only essential workers. Tattoo artists are not essential, so Walker's arrest was likely lawful, though officers unnecessarily escalated the situation as they were arresting him.

### Protester pepper sprayed without cause | May 30th

Footage from a body cam captures an officer approaching a woman standing still with a sign at her feet. The officer then discharges pepper spray at her without warning. This led to an escalation, where less lethal shots can be heard fired. The officer was allegedly aiming for an individual carrying a handicap parking sign several feet from the protester who was pepper sprayed. A police official also suggested that the woman may have been providing cover for agitators behind her. No evidence of this can be seen.

He states that he was maced, hit by a police officer on a bicycle, struck by ricocheting tear gas canisters, and shot 6 times with wooden pellets.
