## Bethel

### Man struck by counter-protester while police look on | 2020-06-14

During a BLM protest in Bethel, Ohio near the Christian Community Church on Plane Street, protesters were met by a substantial counter-protest, which allegedly harrassed and assaulted them. In one particular video, a counter-protester strikes a BLM protester on the back of the head and walk away. There are police officers directly in front of and behind the incident. The man tells the officer he just got punched. The officer's response is difficult to hear above the crowd, but he appears to offer little help, instead telling the protester he is not allowed to demonstrate there (on a public sidewalk).

News report includes footage of counter-protesters using racial slurs, harassing protesters and rip signs out of protester hands while police look on.

It is labeled 5440 Launchable Flameless Expulsion OC.

### Police violently disperse crowds, before curfew and allegedly without provocation | 2020-05-31

Police use tear gas to disperse a crowd near the Hamilton County Courthouse before curfew. No provocation is mentioned in the news article; a first-hand account posted to facebook claims there was none. The account posted to Facebook claims that no order to disperse was given; local news coverage does not mention any order to disperse being given. Mass arrests were conducted at some point the night of the 31st. The account posted to Facebook claims that police surrounded and trapped protesters before curfew, and beat some protesters.

### Tattoo artist arrested while painting the outside of his shop; police fail to deescalate | 2020-05-31

Jamison Walker, a Cincinnati tattoo artist at Black Fern Tattoo, was painting the outside of the shop after curfew (with the owner's permission). He alleges that a police officer told him he could finish his work. The Instagram video begins at some later point as several cops approach. They tell Walker (and at least two other persons present) to "get inside." For around 12 seconds, two police officers, Walker, and one other tattoo shop employee are talking simultaneously; Walker told local news he tried to go inside but one officer blocked his path. One officer can be heard to say "I'm giving you a chance, go in," then another can be heard to say "That's exactly what's going to happen -- no -- no no -- inside, go inside, inside -- go inside, there's no debate -- no, you may not." Said officer then begins arresting Walker. Officers shove Walker against a wall and grab his arms; they yell for him to put his hands behind his back. One officer draws a taser and holds it near Walker's shoulder. Meanwhile, one of Walker's colleagues is filming; police scream at her to "get the fuck back -- get back." It's unclear whether she's standing in a doorway or backed up against a wall. Another officer is acting very aggressively and has his taser drawn until the cop next to him taps him on the arm, at which point he holsters his taser and steps back. In total, at least eight police officers are present, of whom at least two draw their tasers, despite facing little to no resistance.

NOTE: While curfews in many cities exempted anyone going to or from work, Cincinnati's exempted only essential workers. Tattoo artists are not essential, so Walker's arrest was likely lawful, though officers unnecessarily escalated the situation as they were arresting him.

### Protester pepper sprayed without cause | 2020-05-30

Footage from a body cam captures an officer approaching a woman standing still with a sign at her feet. The officer then discharges pepper spray at her without warning. This led to an escalation, where less lethal shots can be heard fired. The officer was allegedly aiming for an individual carrying a handicap parking sign several feet from the protester who was pepper sprayed. A police official also suggested that the woman may have been providing cover for agitators behind her. No evidence of this can be seen.

### Man maced by police | 2020-06-21

Footage shows the aftermath of police macing a man with prosthetic legs on the High Street side of the Ohio Statehouse. Protesters have gathered to give medical aid to the man. His prosthetic legs appear to have been disconnected. Users on Reddit and Twitter state that police disconnected the man's legs.

Additional footage appears to show the prosthetics disconnect when the man was shoved by police. That same footage shows officers spraying other unrelated protesters.

Body cam footage later surfaced showing the man tossing a scooter in the direction of officers. A reporter states no officers were harmed. Body cam footage provided does not show the interactions between the toss and the protester-provided footage.
