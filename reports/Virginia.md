### Officer repeatedly uses stun gun on suspect who said he couldn't breathe | June 5th

Bodycam footage shows an unarmed man walking around in the street. The man allegedly called for oxygen and appears to be in distress, with difficulty communicating his mental state or his medical needs. Another officer arrives on scene and fires his taser at the man. The officer kneels on his neck and continues to tase him. The body cam footage is covered briefly, before showing the other officer pressing his stun gun into the man's neck, then strikes him on the head with the taser. The man screams and attempts to stand. The EMTs assist the police in subduing him, while an officer places his hands in cuffs. Near the end of the footage he can be heard saying, "I can't breathe".  

This footage does not appear to be protest related, but demonstrates a severe escalation in force dealing with a man not in a fit mental state.

### Officers pepper-spray Virginia state delegate peacefully protesting | May 30

In this video, delegate Lee Carter asks officers questions about their methods in the protests. He stands in the way of an advancing line of law enforcement officers; he is pushed to the ground at 1:30 and pepper-sprayed at 2:27. He also claims to have been hit by a flashbang grenade earlier in the protest (see also third link). At some point (see Facebook video), someone who seems to be the delegate shouts "I'm a member of the general assembly. I write the state police budget. They're gonna fucking regret that."

It is unclear how the protest unfolded, and why the police were advancing on the crowd wearing riot gear; police allege that the protest turned violent and some protesters say that they were tear-gassed or shot at with rubber bullets while peacefully protesting or retreating. (See fourth and fifth links.)
