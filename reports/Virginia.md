### Officer repeatedly uses stun gun on suspect who said he couldn't breathe | 2020-06-05

Bodycam footage shows an unarmed man walking around in the street in Mount Vernon, Virginia. The man allegedly called for oxygen and appears to be in distress, with difficulty communicating his mental state or his medical needs. Another officer arrives on scene and fires his taser at the man. The officer kneels on his neck and continues to tase him. The body cam footage is covered briefly, before showing the other officer pressing his stun gun into the man's neck, then strikes him on the head with the taser. The man screams and attempts to stand. The EMTs assist the police in subduing him, while an officer places his hands in cuffs. Near the end of the footage he can be heard saying, "I can't breathe".

This footage does not appear to be protest related, but demonstrates a severe escalation in force dealing with a man not in a fit mental state.

The officer was placed on administrative leave and was later arrested for unspecified charges related to the incident.

### Officers pepper-spray Virginia state delegate peacefully protesting | 2020-05-30

In this video, delegate Lee Carter asks officers questions about their methods during protests. He stands in the way of an advancing line of law enforcement officers; he is pushed to the ground at 1:30 and pepper-sprayed at 2:27. He also claims to have been hit by a flashbang grenade earlier in the protest (see also third link). At some point (see Facebook video), someone who seems to be the delegate shouts "I'm a member of the general assembly. I write the state police budget. They're gonna fucking regret that."

It is unclear how the protest unfolded, and why the police were advancing on the crowd wearing riot gear; police allege that the protest turned violent and some protesters say that they were tear-gassed or shot at with rubber bullets while peacefully protesting or retreating. (See fourth and fifth links.)

The incident occurred at the intersection of Sudley Road and Sudley Manor Drive near Manassas.

### Officer spits on detained protester | 2020-06-01

A police officer spits on a detained protester who is restrained and sitting on the ground. The officer appears to repeat the action after other protesters mention that he's on camera. Extended footage shows the officer continuing to spit on the protester.

The incident appears to have occurred at the enrance to the Robert E. Lee Memorial roundabout on North Allen Avenue.

After a police investigation, Richmond Police stated that a slow-motion review showed the officer was spitting near, rather than at the protester. The protester responded by asking in the media why the officer was spitting so close to him at all.
