### Police push, shove and pepper-spray protestors | June 22nd

First person footage of a protest shows police forcing protestors down a sidewalk. It is unclear why police determined protestors could not continue to protest peacefully at the point of the sidewalk.

Police use their shields to shove protestors along. Footage is dark and a little unclear, but it appears that around 2 minutes, the filmer and her sisters are pepper-sprayed. They scream in pain and the filmer states repeatedly that she cannot see. The filmer then loses track of her sisters. She finds one family member around 4 minutes, who shows clear signs of having been pepper sprayed.

The filmer and her sister attempted to regroup and find their third family member, but police continued to shove them along.

Around 4:15 a protestor is shoved to the ground. She can be heard screaming, "My leg, my leg."

After this, footage cuts to a shot of the filmer turns the camera on herself and her eyes are watering, showing clear indication of pepper spray. It is unclear if this is from the first round of pepper spray or she has been sprayed a second time. Medics attempt to assist her but are forced to continue marching while doing so. Around 7 minutes, medics help her into a car. She is treated for the duration of the footage.

Additional links from a reporter discuss the tactics used by police to intimidate and harass protestors. They also capture the aftermath of the pepper-spraying.

### Police arrest 17 people during a peaceful protest for Black Lives Matter at the State Capitol | July 1st

Black Lives Matter advocates gathered at the Capitol to lobby for the governor to sign an executive order restoring felon voting rights by Saturday, July 4.

White protestors were inside the Capitol, police identified some of them claimed to have vandalized police car in the past, and arrests were made inside the Capitol for those individuals. However, the arrested individuals declined the allegations. The protestors followed the police outside the Capitol, and one of the protestors blocked their path and later the crowd tried to pull the arrestees from the custody of the police officers. That is when more crowds and police started to get involved. Police used pepper spray to help disperse the crowd and arrested 17 people, including two juveniles.

### Iowa State Police use tear gas & flashbangs against crowd of civilians attempting to enter I-80 and later against Iowa City EMS. | June 3rd

State police shoot tear gas into, and deploy flashbangs against, a crowd of peaceful protesters attempting to enter I-80. Some protesters stumble and fall as they try to flee.

Reportedly,  one protester suffered seizures as a result of a flashbang, and an ambulance was called to the scene.

Police continued to deploy tear gas and flashbangs in the area where Iowa city EMT's were working (see flashing white lights in cloud of gas, 5th link). Unclear if they were aware of EMS presence.

According to the mayor, Iowa State Patrol was in command of the scene (though some Iowa City Police were present) and it was determined that letting the protest onto I-80 was too dangerous.
