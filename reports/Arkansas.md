### Law enforcement tear-gas a crowd chanting “we want peace” right after exiting the building. | June 1st

A crowd gathered on the Bentonville Square to protest. Around 9 PM, law enforcement gassed a crowd chanting “we want peace.” Local news says some people were throwing water bottles and firecrackers. Police also claim rocks were thrown. Police claim that at least one police vehicle was damaged. Local news reports vary -- some reports have protesters "kicking" a police vehicle; some televised reports have protesters "damaging" a police vehicle; most written articles merely report that police say protesters damaged a police vehicle.

It is unclear whether any order to disperse was given before the first use of tear gas; in the videos purporting to be from that time, no such order is audible. (In one video -- see third link -- a voice can be heard that sounds like it comes from a PA system, but the words are unclear.) Several people present, including one op-ed writer, claim not to have heard any such order. Orders to disperse were certainly given repeatedly between 9:00 and 11:00, as police continued to deploy tear gas.

Police posted on the City of Bentonville Facebook page that rubber bullets were not used. Police did, in fact, use rubber bullets (per 5 News); per the op ed, the police chief attributed the error to a "communication failure."
