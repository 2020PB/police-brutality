### Restaurant owner shot and killed | June 1st

LMPD and KY National Guard were sent to 26th and Broadway to disperse a gathering (unrelated to protests) in violation of curfew. Police officer Katie Crews crosses the street and begins firing pepper balls at a group standing outside. A pepper ball hit the doorway of YaYa's BBQ (the victim's business), nearly striking his niece. He went outside and appears to fire a single shot into the air. He steps inside and then steps back out and is shot and killed by police and guardsman. Officers were required to wear bodycams and have them activated as a reform after the police killing of Breonna Taylor, but of the 20 officers on scene, LMPD claims 0 were using their bodycams.

### Pastor violently arrested during protest | June 1st

During a protest on June 1st, a pastor was arrested. He states officers yelled at him and told him to move. When he did not, he states that an officer ordered others to arrest him; those officers then threw him to the ground to handcuff him.

Footage from news sources show 2 officers kneeling on his legs and back. It also shows an officer pressing what appears to be a service sidearm to the pastor's head.

After Findley was placed in a squad car, he told police he was a pastor. He was then released without charges.

The pastor is now suing the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department.

### LMPD Bearcat strikes vehicle; police initially state vehicle hit them, then retract the statement; in addition, bystander filming is arrested | July 1st

On July 1st, a collision was reported between a bystander vehicle and an LMPD armored car, also called a Bearcat. Police initially stated that the Bearcat was rammed by a protestor vehicle. They later retracted this statement, saying that in fact the Bearcat hit the vehicle. It is not clear if the vehicle was related to the protest at all. However, police state that they intentionally hit the vehicle to prevent further harm, stating that they recognized the vehicle from an incident the previous night.

A woman filming the incident from her car stepped out and asked someone for their name. She was then arrested.

Additional footage from a bystander shows the filmer running out of the way of the Bearcat to avoid being hit.

### Police target independent journalists and livestreamers for second consecutive night | July 1st

Footage from two livestreamers on July 1st shows their arrests. LMPD arrested livestreamers the previous night as well. It should be noted that these independent journalists are not always credentialed, but they are known for releasing full, unedited footage of the protests.

The ACLU has raised concerns that these arrests are inhibiting freedom of the press, while Louisville Metropolitan Police Department has stated that the department "has no issue with anyone livestreaming. But many of those livestreaming are also protesting. And anyone protesting who fails to follow police orders to disperse may be arrested."

The journalist from MilkyMess TV took 1st person footage of their arrest. Around 1:50:00 in her Facebook live post, she is wandering around a crowd of protestors on the sidewalk. The journalist does not appear to be chanting or singing with protestors. Several police cruisers pull up and officers step out. The journalist steps forward to get a better look and is arrested without a word. The camera is knocked from her hand.

An additional livestream from a reporter affiliated with WDRB News shows the incident. Beginning at 3:05:00, police arrive, appear to single out MilkyMess and tackle her to the ground. The reporter asks why she is being arrested. A police officer says, "Trespassing." It should be noted that MilkyMess was on a public sidewalk and numerous other individuals were not arrested. Around 3:11:00, the WDRB reporter walks over to another arrestee. Shortly after, the reporter asks an officer if he should be in the street or sidewalk. The officer tells him he's "gotta go." The reporter crosses to the other side of the street and asks another person if there were arrests. The individual says there was one arrest. This totals 3 arrests for trespassing on a park/public sidewalk out of a group of 30-40 individuals.

### Police respond to splashed water with excessive force | July 7th

Police are attempting to tow a car and protestors have gathered around in opposition. A protestor splashes water on an officer and attempts to run away. The officer chases her, holds her in a headlock, and forces her to the ground with the aid of several other officers. One officer kneels on the protestor to arrest her while other officers hold the crowd back. One officer can be heard saying repeatedly saying, "Back the fuck off."

The filmer also posted a screenshot, alleging that the protestor was charged with disorderly conduct, possession of marijuana, inciting a riot, and third degree assault of an officer. Third degree assault is generally classified as the intent to cause serious bodily harm, generally with a deadly weapon. The filmer is a journalist with the Courier Journal and is verified on Twitter, lending some credence to her allegations about the charges.
