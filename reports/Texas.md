### Police use horses as weapons | May 30th

In an attempt to clear protestors blocking a road, mounted police began walking their horses into protestors. A handful of protestors refused to move. Rather than arresting the protestors and walking them away, police continued to push them with their horses. At one point, an officer pepper-sprays a protestor. After this protestors begin throwing things at police. The pepper-sprayed protestor swings his sign at the officer. The officer then grabs the protestor by the backpack and drags him down the road until other protestors intervene to free him. Another officer tramples one of these protestors. Protestors continue to shout at police for the duration of the footage.

Charges were filed against the protestor for swinging his sign at police. Police say the sign had a wooden stick attached, but footage indicates it was only a piece of cardboard, cardstock, or similar paper material.
