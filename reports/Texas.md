### Police use horses as weapons | 2020-05-30

In an attempt to clear protesters blocking a road, mounted police began walking their horses into protesters. A handful of protesters refused to move. Rather than arresting the protesters and walking them away, police continued to push them with their horses. At one point, an officer pepper-sprays a protester. After this protesters begin throwing things at police. The pepper-sprayed protester swings his sign at the officer. The officer then grabs the protester by the backpack and drags him down the road until other protesters intervene to free him. Another officer tramples one of these protesters. Protesters continue to shout at police for the duration of the footage.

Charges were filed against the protester for swinging his sign at police. Police say the sign had a wooden stick attached, but footage indicates it was only a piece of cardboard, cardstock, or similar paper material.
