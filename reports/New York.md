### Police shove elderly man, causing him to fall and hit the back of his head | June 4th

Two police officers shove an unarmed, elderly man ([reportedly 75 years old](https://twitter.com/HannahBuehler/status/1268742666210226177)), who falls backwards and strikes his head on the concrete sidewalk. He appears to begin bleeding from his ear and passes out.

Buffalo P.D. released an official statement saying that he "tripped and fell." After video of the incident surfaced, however, both officers were suspended, an internal affairs investigation was opened, and both officers were charged with assault. In response to the suspension, the Buffalo Emergency Response Team [resigned from their posts](https://nypost.com/2020/06/05/buffalo-emergency-response-team-quits-in-solidarity-of-cops/). At first, the two officers were suspended without pay, but because the Buffalo police contract only allows suspension without pay for 30 days, they are now (as of July 10) suspended with pay.

The man suffered brain damage and has begun physical therapy.

### NYPD rams protesters | May 30th

An NYPD SUV's path is blocked by a crowd of protesters. Protesters begin throwing things at the SUV. Another NYPD SUV drives up alongside the first, then drives through the crowd, forcing protesters out of its way. The first car then drives forward, ramming the dense crowd of civilians in front of it. NYPD's internal affairs bureau conducted a review and found no wrongdoing. The police commissioner said that "preliminarily we have an accounting of that incident where we have officers in a situation where they're essentially being penned in by protesters," but it seems from the video as though, throughout the incident, both cars have a clear route of escape behind them.

### Alleged looter pulled from car and beaten | June 1st

Footage shows a cluster of NYPD officers striking a vehicle with batons and kicking it, before pulling the driver onto the street and arresting them. Footage shows police smashed several of the car's windows.

Officers allege the driver and passenger were looters and had tried to run over police.

Officers additionally allege that the passenger attempted to jump to the driver's seat, run over an NYPD officer, and drive away. However, footage shows heavy traffic on all sides of the car and does not capture the alleged attempt by the passenger.

The driver was charged with attempted murder, assault with intent to cause injury, criminal possession of stolen property, and obstructing government administration. The DA's office later downgraded the attempted murder charge to second-degree assault.

### Protesters detained more than 24 hours by police; upheld by NY Judge | June 4th

The Legal Aid Society, a law firm for low-income families and individuals, filed an emergency lawsuit after learning protesters had been detained for over 24 hours without arraignment, in violation of New York state law.

A New York state judge rejected the appeal, allowing the NYPD to continue holding protesters, citing the virtual arraignments made necessary by the COVID-19 pandemic as a cause of slower processing. However, the Legal Aid Society states that conditions are not suitable for social distancing in the holding cells, thus risking an increased spread of COVID-19.

The NY Daily News cited that as of Thursday, June 4th, 202 people had been detained for over 24 hours.
