### NYPD rams protesters | May 30th

An NYPD SUV's path is blocked by a crowd of protesters. Protesters begin throwing things at the SUV. Another NYPD SUV drives up alongside the first, then drives through the crowd, forcing protesters out of its way. The first car then drives forward, ramming the dense crowd of civilians in front of it. NYPD's internal affairs bureau conducted a review and found no wrongdoing. The police commissioner said that "preliminarily we have an accounting of that incident where we have officers in a situation where they're essentially being penned in by protesters," but it seems from the video as though, throughout the incident, both cars have a clear route of escape behind them.

### Protestors detained more than 24 hours by police; upheld by NY Judge | June 4th

The Legal Aid Society, a law firm for low-income families and individuals, filed an emergency lawsuit after learning protestors had been detained for over 24 hours without arraignment, in violation of New York state law.

A New York state judge rejected the appeal, allowing the NYPD to continue holding protestors, citing the virtual arraignments made necessary by the COVID-19 pandemic as a cause of slower processing. However, the Legal Aid Society states that conditions are not suitable for social distancing in the holding cells, thus risking an increased spread of COVID-19.

The NY Daily News cited that as of Thursday, June 4th, 202 people had been detained for over 24 hours.
