### Police break up a small protest and shoots at them as they leave | 2020-06-14

There is a very small protest of what appears to be no more than 15 people. Police arrive declaring it an unlawful assembly. Some of the protesters, including the person filming, go into a nearby restaurant because their car was in the direction of the police and they did not feel comfortable walking towards them. Two militarized police come into the restaurant and make them exit. The police tell them to run, motioning with their hands in the direction away from the protester's car, despite the protester trying to explain that they need to go in the other direction to actually leave. They run as they are told, and say they have their hands up. It then appears the police fire rubber bullets at them, the camera was facing away from the police but it picks up the sounds. The video is in two parts and includes further context via subtitles.

### Police tear gas peaceful protest, including worshipping congregation | 2020-05-31

On Sunday May 31st at Monument Circle in Indianapolis, police state they, prior to curfew, were attempting to apprehend a man who allegedly was trying to spray-paint a statue.

To do so, police tear-gassed the entire group gathered, which included 50 members of Liberty Tabernacle, who had gathered to sing, pray and listen to speakers. A tear-gas canister landed at the feet of one member of the congregation who uses a wheelchair.

At a news conference on June 1st, the Police chief stated: "My sincere apologies for anyone who was in this peaceful demonstration downtown that was impacted by the tear gas."

### Police beat woman with batons and shoot pepper balls, shove another to the ground | 2020-05-31

A woman is seen being restrained by a police officer who stands behind her with his arms around her torso. She struggles with the officer and breaks free, after which she is repeatedly beaten on the thighs with batons and shot with what appear to be pepper balls by officers shouting "Get on the ground!" while she is standing still. Another woman walks towards the officers with her hands out, seeming to plead for restraint but not directly interfering. An officer yells at her to "Back up!" and then violently shoves her to the ground.

Two IMPD officers have since been indicted for battery and other use of force charges.
