### Reporter for The Blade arrested at protest | 2020-08-09

A journalist working for The Asheville Blade was following protests in their car on August 9th. They state that police stopped them without warning, pulled them out of their car, zip-tied and arrested them. They state that because of the heat, their sweat made their hands slippery and their zip-ties fell off; an officer then replaced them with standard handcuffs, cuffing the journalist's arms tightly behind their back.

They state that after being removed from the police wagon, they were patted down. A female cop stood by while a male cop patted them down. The journalist states the male cop's "hands aggressively slid over my vagina and my ass."

They were held in a cell for several hours, in and out of cuffs. Several police officers asked the journalist if they were going to behave now, and made other similar comments.

Images taken after release show significant bruising on one of the journalist's arms.

### Police target, follow and arrest protester | 2020-06-04

On June 4th, Conrad James, a prominent protester in Raleigh, threatened to file a class action lawsuit against the Raleigh police departments.

In the early hours of the morning on June 5th, men in black, without visible badge numbers, raided James' home and arrested him for allegedly failing to return a rental car. James denies these claims. The arrest took place in a county under the jurisdiction of the Wake County Sheriff's Office and the Fuquay-Varina Police Department. The sheriff's office, the Fuquay-Varina Police, and the Raleigh Police give differing accounts about the departments involved and the time at which the raid took place.

Police scanner audio shows that Raleigh police officers were following him during protests later that day.
