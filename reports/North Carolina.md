### Police target, follow and arrest protestor | June 4th

On June 4th, Conrad James, a prominent protestor in Raleigh, threatened to file a class action lawsuit against the Raleigh police departments.

In the early hours of the morning on June 5th, men in black, without visible badge numbers, raided James' home and arrested him for allegedly failing to return a rental car. James denies these claims. The arrest took place in a county under the jurisdiction of the Wake County Sheriff's Office and the Fuquay-Varina Police Department. The sheriff's office, the Fuquay-Varina Police, and the Raleigh Police give differing accounts about the departments involved and the time at which the raid took place.

Police scanner audio shows that Raleigh police officers were following him during protests later that day.
