### Police deploy smoke canister at reporter and protester | 2020-06-01

A reporter is seen walking down the street towards police while interviewing a protester. Police fire a canister which explodes at their feet. Initially, the reporter believed it to be tear gas, but it was in fact smoke. However, he states the protest was peaceful and officers gave no warning before firing. The journalist says he spoke with another officer who found the incident "odd" and additionally stated that smoke is sometimes used because protesters will disperse, thinking it's tear gas.

### Police on bikes restrain man using knee on neck | 2020-06-02

Protesters were congregating at the intersection of North 6th Street and McKinley Avenue. A group of officers on bikes rode up to them. Two officers on bikes collided with one another; one officer fell to the ground. Officers then tackled a protester (for reasons unknown) and attempted to take him into custody, with one officer placing a knee on his neck or head for one or two minutes. No officers intervened to get the knee off the man's neck; police formed a barrier to screen the arrest from other protesters and people filming. At the same time, police arrested one other man and hit a woman in the collarbone -- again, for reasons unknown. The man who had an officer's knee on his neck has sued.

### Police use excessive force to disperse protesters | 2020-06-02

Protesters had congregated near the intersection of North 6th Street and McKinley Avenue. Over the course of about an hour, police moved forward, dispersing the protesters using tear gas and rubber bullets, first pushing the protesters a block and a half then pushing them off of North 6th Street entirely. Video shows police shooting rubber bullets at protesters on a sidewalk and firing gas canisters, in large number, at a small group of peaceful protesters. (At least some tear gas was used, but it is unclear how much. Police say they also used smoke canisters.)

Police claim they used force to disperse the crowd after rocks and glass were thrown at them. Police also said at the time that "Molotov cocktails" were thrown at them. They later walked that statement back to say that one Molotov Cocktail was thrown. They say it did not ignite. Media and protesters present say they saw water bottles being thrown, but not glass, rocks, or a Molotov cocktail. Video released by police clearly shows something being thrown at police, but doesn't show what it was. Police also produced a picture of a crushed water bottle and what looks like a water pump and implied it was the remnants of a Molotov cocktail.

NOTE: this incident immediately follows wi-milwaukee-1. Because the misconduct involved is substantially different, it has been given its own incident.

## Wauwatosa

### Police fire tear gas and pepper balls at protesters | 2020-10-07

Protesters rallied in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin after it was announced an officer would not be charged in the death of a black teen, which occurred in February. Protesters threw small projectiles at police and police in riot gear responded with tear gas and impact munitions (believed to be pepper balls). Prior to this, protesters had allegedly thrown objects at residential homes. However, it cannot be confirmed if those rioters were at all related to the group of protesters gassed here.

Bystander vehicles were caught in the gas and had to use the sidewalk to flee.

The incident occurred near North Ave and Menomonie River Parkway.

### National Guard officers violently arrest journalists | 2020-10-08

Several journalists, one independent reporter and several representing The Daily Caller, were sitting in a car in the parking lot of St. Matthew's Evangelical Lutheran Church in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A local news crew captured National Guard officers pulling them from the car, slamming the independent reporter to the pavement. The independent reporter and one Daily Caller reporter were arrested. The independent reporter was held longer than The Daily Caller reporter, but appears to have been released early on October 9th. One Daily Caller reporter also reports being struck with a baton.

Additional footage shows a Daily Caller filming arrests of protesters made by National Guard. The officers tell the Daily Caller reporter to leave the are. He states he is press but returns to his car in the parking lot nonetheless. Officers follow him to his car, causing the incident.

The independent journalist has since tweeted that he sustained a concussion.

### Police violently arrest man in bathrobe for curfew violation | 2020-10-09

Footage was taken at the intersection of N 70th Street and W North Avenue in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. Officers in a passing car yell at an individual on the sidewalk to go inside. The officer clarifies that the filmer is exempt, as "ACLU is fine." The officer then proceeds to arrest the individual on the sidewalk, flipping the individual over his knee, and kneeling on his back. Several officers come to aid in making the arrest. Officers continue to tell the individual to stop resisting, though the individual is pinned to the ground.

It is unclear if the individual was related to a protest, but they appear to be wearing a bathrobe, which might suggest they are not prepared for a protest.
