### Fargo deputy police chief instigates unrest during protest | June 1st

In an email sent to the Fargo PD, the deputy chief of police, Todd Osmundson, apologized for instigating unrest during George Floyd protests. He admits to carrying alcoholic containers and to cursing at police officers.

At this protest, individuals were charged with inciting a riot; Osmundson was not one of those individuals despite his unruly presence and aggressive remarks.

Earlier that day, Osmundson appeared in uniform at protests, carrying a supportive sign.
