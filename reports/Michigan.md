### Reporter detained without apparent cause | May 31st

Footage shows a reporter walking across a park to film an arrest. She is approached by an officer (off camera) who asks who she is with. He then zip-ties her and walks her to another location. Around 4:20, she is released. An individual explaining (not seen, but has the same voice as the arresting officer) says, "You were hanging out with those two people. It looked like they were throwing bottles at us. Do us a favor and trip them when they're running or something to make it easier on us."

Footage from another reporter shows her handcuffed and led to the car. This reporter states that a group of press intervened to have her released.

### Police charge protestors and press | June 2nd

Police line is seen using shields to push back a small group of protestors. The filmer, a reporter, moves around to the other side of the protestors. At this point, the footage captures another group of police officers charging the protestors from behind without warning.

The footage becomes blurry as it appears that police strike the reporter, who repeatedly states, "I am press," and is standing alongside several camera crews.

The reporter states that they were beaten by police, their glasses were broken, and their phone thrown. In a subsequent video, the reporter speaks to the police chief and states in the description that they were pepper-sprayed. The police chief states that he will open an investigation. A second reporter off-screen tells the chief that multiple journalists were assaulted.

### Police use LRAD (sound cannon) to disperse protestors | June 2nd

Video shows sound cannon deployed alongside APC. The LRAD can be heard with its characteristic alarm.

The use of LRADs is a subject of much contention, with frequent reports of permanent nerve and hearing damage caused by their use.

The ACLU's [position](https://www.aclu.org/fact-sheet/acoustic-weapons-fact-sheet) is that due to the high risk of damage and lack of research on lasting effects, LRADs should not be deployed to disperse protests.
