### Police pull black women out of the car and throw them to the ground | May 31st

Police are seen attacking a car and pulling two black women out of a car and shoving them to the ground (unclear motive). Block Club Chicago states the victims were detained for disorderly conduct and that police drove off with one of the victims in the car, leaving the other two in the lot.

Victim states that officers kneeled on her neck, that shards of glass from her broken window lacerated her face, and that an officer called her "a f---- savage." In addition, she states she was not given access to an attorney and was not allowed a phone call for 6 hours.

After release (with neither charges nor explanation), the victim attempted to file a complaint but was told the complaint line was unnaccesible.

This was reported to have happened at "2600 N. Narragansett Ave.", but 2700 N seems slightly more accurate. Google Streetview at that address shows the same "Show Carnival" store seen in the video.
