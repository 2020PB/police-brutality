### Philadelphia Police Trap Protesters on Highway, Then Tear Gas Them and Shoot Rubber Bullets | June 1st

An estimated 3000-5000 protesters moved onto Interstate 676, stopping traffic. Protesters move into a tunnel under 20th street. An eye-witness states that officers inside the tunnel (eastbound on I-676) began shooting rubber bullets and macing protesters without any warning or any instructions to halt the protest on the highway. Protesters clear the tunnel, many kneel and put their hands up. Police shoot tear gas at protesters to disperse the crowd, they escape to the hill between 20th and 21st street as there was tear gas westbound on the interstate and they were still being fired at by officers in the tunnel to the east. Some throw canisters back. Officers chase protesters up the hill and appear to detain a number of them. Other officers continue to fire tear gas on to the hill, despite the only visible escape from the tear gas being over a ~10 ft fence.

### Police shove protestors and strike man across the face with a baton | Jun 1st

Police shove a group of protestors. A particularly aggressive police officer in a white shirt runs and shoves someone, then grabs another man. He is then approached by a young man with long hair whom he strikes with his baton, at full strength, in the head before jumping on him and cuffing him. He has assistance from another officer who presses the man's face to the pavement using his knee on his neck. Twitter accounts misreport the individual as female; later accounts in media report the individual is a male Temple University engineering student.

He now faces charges of aggravated assault, simple assault, possession of an instrument of crime and recklessly endangering another person. His bail was set at $10,000. The officer has been suspended with intent to dismiss him. The protester was detained for 24 hours, but ultimately released without charges.

### Reporter is harassed and assaulted by pro-Columbus supporters; police tell reporter to leave the scene | June 13th

A reporter from Unicorn Riot showed up at a pro-Columbus rally at a statue of Christopher Columbus in Philadelphia. He is harassed, threatened and assaulted by members of the rally. In addition, an article published by Unicorn Riot states that members of the rally slashed the journalist's tires.  After several minutes, police intervene to push protestors back, but make no arrests. They appear to say nothing more to members of the rally than, "Leave him alone."

The reporter continues to film from a distance.

Around 6:20, the journalist is assaulted again by a man who says he doesn't want the journalist to film.

Shortly after, the journalist is told by the officer that he has been warned 3 times to leave. The journalist insists he is here to film. The officer states that the journalist is inciting a riot and should be mindful of the curfew time.

### Police tear-gas, shoot and arrest protestor confused by contradicting police instructions | May 30th

John Connors, a protestor in Pittsburgh on Saturday, May 30th, was recording the protest on his phone, when police told him to leave the area or risk arrest. He is heard asking which direction to go. The direction given was already blocked off, so he asked for more clarity. He was given additional instructions and made his way towards a 7/11.

He asks an officer, "Are you guys police officers or are you guys cops?" The officer then release a tear gas canister at his feet and shoots him at short range. Police then arrest Connors. Connors admits his question was antagonizing, but states he did nothing to threaten officers or escalate to violence, which is supported by the footage.
