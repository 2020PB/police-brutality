### Philadelphia Police Trap Protesters on Highway, Then Tear Gas Them and Shoot Rubber Bullets | June 1st

An estimated 3000-5000 protesters moved onto Interstate 676, stopping traffic. Protesters move into a tunnel under 20th street. An eye-witness states that officers inside the tunnel (eastbound on I-676) began shooting rubber bullets and macing protesters without any warning or any instructions to halt the protest on the highway. Protesters clear the tunnel, many kneel and put their hands up. Police shoot tear gas at protesters to disperse the crowd, they escape to the hill between 20th and 21st street as there was tear gas westbound on the interstate and they were still being fired at by officers in the tunnel to the east. Some throw canisters back. Officers chase protesters up the hill and appear to detain a number of them. Other officers continue to fire tear gas on to the hill, despite the only visible escape from the tear gas being over a ~10 ft fence.

### Police selectively enforce curfew and dispersal orders | June 1st

During protests, groups of men armed with guns, bats, and other blunt instruments roved around the Fishtown neighborhood of Philadelphia. They continued patrolling after curfew. Footage shows Philadelphia police warning militia to leave so they could enforce arrests of BLM protestors. In addition, images show police chatting and taking photos with the groups. One video taken by a gunman states that the police want to take pictures with them.

Footage shows members of the groups threatening and shouting racial and homophobic slurs at protestors without police intervention. One journalist posted a picture of himself with a head wound, alleging that one of these groups beat him for filming them.

## Pittsburgh

### Police tear-gas, shoot and arrest protestor confused by contradicting police instructions | May 30th

John Connors, a protestor in Pittsburgh on Saturday, May 30th, was recording the protest on his phone, when police told him to leave the area or risk arrest. He is heard asking which direction to go. The direction given was already blocked off, so he asked for more clarity. He was given additional instructions and made his way towards a 7/11.

He asks an officer, "Are you guys police officers or are you guys cops?" The officer then release a tear gas canister at his feet and shoots him at short range. Police then arrest Connors. Connors admits his question was antagonizing, but states he did nothing to threaten officers or escalate to violence, which is supported by the footage.
