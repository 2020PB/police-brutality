## Lancaster

### Police tear gas protesters | 2020-09-13

Following a police shooting in Lancaster, protesters gathered at West Chestnut and North Prince Streets, forming makeshift barricades in the road. Police responded with chemical agents - believed by protesters to be tear gas, though police claim it was "OC spray," the same compound as pepper spray. However, a spent canister recovered by a journalist shows police used "CS smoke," or tear gas.

12 Protesters were arrested. One was a minor who was shortly released. Seven are being held on $1,000,000 bail (current as of September 15th, 2020). The ACLU has released a statement decrying the high bail.

### Philadelphia Police Trap Protesters on Highway, Then Tear Gas Them and Shoot Rubber Bullets | 2020-06-01

An estimated 3000-5000 protesters moved onto Interstate 676, stopping traffic. Protesters move into a tunnel under 20th street. An eye-witness states that officers inside the tunnel (eastbound on I-676) began shooting rubber bullets and macing protesters without any warning or any instructions to halt the protest on the highway. Protesters clear the tunnel, many kneel and put their hands up. Police shoot tear gas at protesters to disperse the crowd, they escape to the hill between 20th and 21st street as there was tear gas westbound on the interstate and they were still being fired at by officers in the tunnel to the east. Some throw canisters back. Officers chase protesters up the hill and appear to detain a number of them. Other officers continue to fire tear gas on to the hill, despite the only visible escape from the tear gas being over a ~10 ft fence.

### Police shove protesters and strike man across the face with a baton | 2020-06-01

Police shove a group of protesters near the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. A particularly aggressive police officer in a white shirt runs and shoves someone, then grabs another man. He is then approached by a young man with long hair whom he strikes with his baton, at full strength, in the head before jumping on him and cuffing him. He has assistance from another officer who presses the man's face to the pavement using his knee on his neck. Twitter accounts misreport the individual as female; later accounts in media report the individual is a male Temple University engineering student.

He now faces charges of aggravated assault, simple assault, possession of an instrument of crime and recklessly endangering another person. His bail was set at $10,000. The officer has been suspended with intent to dismiss him. The protester was detained for 24 hours, but ultimately released without charges.

### Police selectively enforce curfew and dispersal orders | 2020-06-01

During protests, groups of men armed with guns, bats, and other blunt instruments roved around the Fishtown neighborhood of Philadelphia. They continued patrolling after curfew. Footage shows Philadelphia police warning militia to leave so they could enforce arrests of BLM protesters. In addition, images show police chatting and taking photos with the groups. One video taken by a gunman states that the police want to take pictures with them.

Footage shows members of the groups threatening and shouting racial and homophobic slurs at protesters without police intervention. One journalist posted a picture of himself with a head wound, alleging that one of these groups beat him for filming them.

### Reporter is harassed and assaulted by pro-Columbus supporters; police tell reporter to leave the scene | 2020-06-13

A reporter from Unicorn Riot showed up at a pro-Columbus rally at a statue of Christopher Columbus in Philadelphia. He is harassed, threatened and assaulted by members of the rally. In addition, an article published by Unicorn Riot states that members of the rally slashed the journalist's tires.  After several minutes, police intervene to push protesters back, but make no arrests. They appear to say nothing more to members of the rally than, "Leave him alone."

The reporter continues to film from a distance.

Around 6:20, the journalist is assaulted again by a man who says he doesn't want the journalist to film.

Shortly after, the journalist is told by the officer that he has been warned 3 times to leave. The journalist insists he is here to film. The officer states that the journalist is inciting a riot and should be mindful of the curfew time.

Police are seen shoving a protester and striking him with batons before knocking him to the ground.

This appears to have occurred during a push on Pine street, between 52nd and 55th streets. In additional footage, officers can be seen shoving protesters to the ground.

### Police break car windows, pull passengers from vehicle, and beat them | 2020-10-27

Philadelphia police approach a car in the street on the 5200 block of Chestnut Street, beating it with their batons. Officers then smash out the driver side window before opening the door, beating the driver and front passenger with batons. Police also pulled a child out of the backseat of the car. Later reporting has stated that the driver and her 16 year old out of the car. They were hospitalized and handcuffed to their hospital beds while being treated. The following morning they were released without charges, though the mother's hospital bracelet read: "assault on police." The driver was able to contact her mother, the grandmother of the child pulled from the backseat. The grandmother went to the scene of the incident, then was directed four miles away, where she found the boy in a squad car. She said the boy had a lump on his head and his carseat still contained glass from the broken windows. An attorney representing the family has stated they have been told neither the current location of the family's SUV nor any process to retrieve the vehicle. The lawyer also states that the family is showing signs of trauma, including the young boy, who is hearing impaired and still learning to speak.

Several days later, the Fraternal Order of Police posted on several social media outlets that they had rescued a child wandering barefoot on the streets during the protest, following by several police slogans, like "We are the thin blue line," and reiterating a common pro-police point about standing between order and anarchy. The child in the post was in fact the child pulled by police from the car. The posts have since been deleted. The day after the posts (10/30), the Fraternal Order of Police released a statement saying there were "conflicted accounts under which the child came to be assisted by the officer."

### Police tear-gas, shoot and arrest protester confused by contradicting police instructions | 2020-05-30

John Connors, a protester in Pittsburgh on Saturday, May 30th, was recording the protest on his phone near Liberty Avenue and 7th Street. Police told him to leave the area or risk arrest. He is heard asking which direction to go. The direction given was already blocked off, so he asked for more clarity. He was given additional instructions and made his way towards a 7/11.

He asks an officer, "Are you guys police officers or are you guys cops?" The officer then release a tear gas canister at his feet and shoots him at short range. Police then arrest Connors. Connors admits his question was antagonizing, but states he did nothing to threaten officers or escalate to violence, which is supported by the footage.

### Officer pepper-sprays a woman who is on her knees with her hands up | 2020-06-01

A woman in East Liberty (5700 Centre Avenue) gets onto her knees and puts her hands in the air, while repeatedly yelling "we're peaceful, don't shoot!" Officers approach her and one of them sprays pepper spray onto her. The woman who recorded the video, Abigail Rubio, claims the police returned the next day and claimed they had video evidence of her throwing items off her balcony at them, a claim she denies and says was meant to intimidate her after posting the video. She filed a complaint with the local Citizen Review Board.

Users on Twitter allege the woman was a medic attempting to notify the police and/or provide aid to an injured person in a nearby parking garage.

The LRAD dispersal function can also be heard.
