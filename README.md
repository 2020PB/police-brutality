This repository exists to accumulate and contextualize evidence of police brutality during the 2020 George Floyd protests.

Our goal in doing this is to assist journalists, politicians, prosecutors, activists and concerned citizens who can use the evidence accumulated here for political campaigns, news reporting, public education and prosecution of criminal police officers.

This was first started as a megathread on the subreddit [/r/2020PoliceBrutality](https://www.reddit.com/r/2020PoliceBrutality) but after being overwhelmed by people looking to contribute, we decided to make a github repository so that everyone who wants to can easily contribute to the project directly.

If you are here looking for evidence of police brutality, please refer to the table of contents for links to incident reports sorted by state.

## Background

On May 25, 2020 an African American man named George Floyd was murdered by police officer Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis, a city with a police department [known for its use of excessive force](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/us/minneapolis-police.html). George Floyd's murder sparked a wave of protests across the nation as citizens became outraged by another example of police misconduct in the midst of a historic financial and public health crisis caused by the Coronavirus pandemic.

In response to the burgeoning civil unrest, numerous police departments violently cracked down on peaceful demonstrations and drastically escalated confrontations with protesters. As videos of these crack-downs circulated on social media over the following hours and days, the protests escalated nationally and every major city in the country saw mass protests, with some experiencing riots that resulted in mass property destruction and saw buildings burned down.
As these protests have continued, hundreds of incidents have been recorded where police engaged in unprovoked violent assaults, outright police brutality and unprovoked arrests and harassment.

# TODOs

*This is a list of proposed TODOs, a set of ideas for those who own this codebase and have contributed to it this far, and in hopes of sparking further discussion  from any technical folk joining this project.*

I believe the focus needs to be: What are the most critical things to be accomplised to make this project as successful as possible in the shortest time-frame as possible. I think a few things:
- I think there is a need to collect as much illegal activity by the authorities in the shortest time frame possible.  To that end, I would propose a few things:
  - A generalized, true API for submitting abuses.
  - A submission service that stores descriptions of abuses and their assets in a modern data storage system
  - A UI to allow users on desktop/mobile to submit links by hand
  - A Twitter bot that people can @ / mention to easily submit abuses via social media. I think twitter is the most productive platform to target.

Additionally, I see a need for a more robust API to delivery the content collected. The easier it is for people to consume the data, the faster people make cool things with it, like that fantastic Front-End that was made for this project.

Strike while the iron is hot, as I see it. This data is ephemeral, as each day goes by, it's harder to backtrack to find the worst abuses that maybe didn't get the spotlot as others.

I have many other thoughts on infrastructure, deployment, et cetera.
