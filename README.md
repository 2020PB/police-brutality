# /r/2020PoliceBrutality/ dataset

This repository exists to accumulate and contextualize evidence of police brutality during the 2020 George Floyd protests.

Our goal in doing this is to assist journalists, politicians, prosecutors, activists and concerned individuals who can use the evidence accumulated here for political campaigns, news reporting, public education and prosecution of criminal police officers.
