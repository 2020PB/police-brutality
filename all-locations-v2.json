Officers shove Walker against a wall and grab his arms; they yell for him to put his hands behind his back. One officer draws a taser and holds it near Walker's shoulder. Meanwhile, one of Walker's colleagues is filming; police scream at her to \"get the fuck back -- get back.\" It's unclear whether she's standing in a doorway or backed up against a wall. Another officer is acting very aggressively and has his taser drawn until the cop next to him taps him on the arm, at which point he holsters his taser and steps back. In total, at least eight police officers are present, of whom at least two draw their tasers, despite facing little to no resistance.\n\nNOTE: While curfews in many cities exempted anyone going to or from work, Cincinnati's exempted only essential workers.

Video released by police clearly shows something being thrown at police, but doesn't show what it was.
