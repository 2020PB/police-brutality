A group of around 3 young people decided to hold an impromptu counter-protest, and parked across the street from the CVP protesters. CVP protesters came across the street and began shouting at the counter-protesters. Some time later, video shows one counter-protester on the ground, on the CVP proesters' side of the street, being beaten by CVP protesters. Another counter-protester is trying to intervene but being physically restrained by CVP protesters; a third is filming the incident as CVP protesters heckle her. Photos taken after the incident show at least two of the protesters badly beaten. Each side says the other started the altercation.\n\nPolice arrived shortly thereafter. They told the counter-protesters to wait in police cars (allegedly for their own protection); the counter-protesters say they were kept in police cars for nearly an hour. The CVP protesters were not put into police cars. One counter-protester says that counter-protesters tried to leave multiple times, but were told that they were not free to go. Police can be seen shaking the hand of one of the CVP protesters; counter-protesters claim police were somewhat dismissive of their allegations of assault against the CVP protesters.

Officers shove Walker against a wall and grab his arms; they yell for him to put his hands behind his back. One officer draws a taser and holds it near Walker's shoulder. Meanwhile, one of Walker's colleagues is filming; police scream at her to \"get the fuck back -- get back.\" It's unclear whether she's standing in a doorway or backed up against a wall. Another officer is acting very aggressively and has his taser drawn until the cop next to him taps him on the arm, at which point he holsters his taser and steps back.

Officers took protesters' bags and dumped them onto the sidewalk.\n\nThe 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gives individuals the right to privacy and freedom from unreasonable searches. Most warrantless searches are considered unreasonable, with the exception of searches with consent of the searched or with probable cause. By disallowing protesters to leave, police did not allow protesters to consent. Further, probable cause has been determined on several occassions to be individualized, meaning that individuals on the premises of a crime scene cannot be searched simply for being present; rather, probable cause must be established for each individual, as in [Ybarra v. Illinois](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1979/78-5937) and [United States v. Di Re](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/332/581/). This means that, in order to search protester's belongings, police would have needed to establish probable cause for each protester searched.\n\nThe Terry standard does allow police to briefly detain and search an individual on reasonable suspicion, which has a lower bar than probable cause. In [Terry v. Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/392/1/), the U.S. Supreme Court stated that police may stop and frisk - which is limited to an external pat down (e.g. for an readily-usable weapon), but does not include bag searches - an individual on the basis of reasonable suspicion. Reasonable suspicion is defined in the case as the reasonable suspicion that an individual may have committed, be committing, or is about to commit a crime. There must additionally be the reasonable belief that the individual is armed and dangerous. In addition, this reasonable suspicion is individualized, so police must have established reasonable suspicion that each protester searched was both armed and engaged in, had engaged in, or was going to engage in criminal conduct.\n\nAfter reviewing the rights of protesters, it appears that police conducted these searches illegally, abusing their power to prevent protesters from leaving.", "tags": ["protester", "abuse-of-power"], "name": "Police surround protesters and search their bags", "date": "2020-08-15", "date_text": "August 15th", "id": "il-chicago-30"}, {"links": [{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rllO2sdj1Ek", "text": ""}, {"url": "https://twitter.com/OrozcoJustina/status/1268262843801010179", "text": ""}, {"url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-joliet-mayor-video-fallout-20200606-zeidd3u5xbadxfoedmfkp22akm-story.html", "text": ""}], "state": "Illinois", "edit_at": "https://github.com/2020PB/police-brutality/blob/main/reports/Illinois.md", "city": "Joliet", "description": "Protesters arrested as they're leaving, including one grabbed by the neck by city mayor, Bob O'Dekirk, and dogpiled by at least 3 police officers.", "tags": ["beat", "shove", "throw", "protester"], "name": "Officers grabs someone by the neck then more cops pile on", "date": "2020-05-31", "date_text": "May 31st", "id": "il-joliet-1"}, {"links": [{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfRZkKR9l3w", "text": ""}], "state": "Illinois", "edit_at": "https://github.com/2020PB/police-brutality/blob/main/reports/Illinois.md", "city": "Rockford", "description": "An individual in a stopped car gets out and yells at police, ostensibly about the road closure by police vehicles.
