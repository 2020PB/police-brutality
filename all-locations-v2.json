Police refused to allow protesters to leave without a bag search. Officers took protesters' bags and dumped them onto the sidewalk.\n\nThe 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gives individuals the right to privacy and freedom from unreasonable searches. Most warrantless searches are considered unreasonable, with the exception of searches with consent of the searched or with probable cause. By disallowing protesters to leave, police did not allow protesters to consent. Further, probable cause has been determined on several occassions to be individualized, meaning that individuals on the premises of a crime scene cannot be searched simply for being present; rather, probable cause must be established for each individual, as in [Ybarra v. Illinois](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1979/78-5937) and [United States v. Di Re](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/332/581/). This means that, in order to search protester's belongings, police would have needed to establish probable cause for each protester searched.\n\nThe Terry standard does allow police to briefly detain and search an individual on reasonable suspicion, which has a lower bar than probable cause. In [Terry v. Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/392/1/), the U.S. Supreme Court stated that police may stop and frisk - which is limited to an external pat down (e.g. for an readily-usable weapon), but does not include bag searches - an individual on the basis of reasonable suspicion. Reasonable suspicion is defined in the case as the reasonable suspicion that an individual may have committed, be committing, or is about to commit a crime. There must additionally be the reasonable belief that the individual is armed and dangerous. In addition, this reasonable suspicion is individualized, so police must have established reasonable suspicion that each protester searched was both armed and engaged in, had engaged in, or was going to engage in criminal conduct.\n\nAfter reviewing the rights of protesters, it appears that police conducted these searches illegally, abusing their power to prevent protesters from leaving.", "tags": ["abuse-of-power", "protester"], "geolocation": "41.8800529, -87.6322486", "name": "Police surround protesters and search their bags", "date": "2020-08-15", "date_text": "2020-08-15", "id": "il-chicago-30"}, {"links": [{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rllO2sdj1Ek", "text": ""}, {"url": "https://twitter.com/OrozcoJustina/status/1268262843801010179", "text": ""}, {"url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-joliet-mayor-video-fallout-20200606-zeidd3u5xbadxfoedmfkp22akm-story.html", "text": ""}], "state": "Illinois", "edit_at": "https://github.com/2020PB/police-brutality/blob/main/reports/Illinois.md", "city": "Joliet", "description": "Protesters arrested as they're leaving, including one grabbed by the neck by city mayor, Bob O'Dekirk, and dogpiled by at least 3 police officers.", "tags": ["beat", "protester", "shove", "throw"], "geolocation": "41.5227515, -88.1208659", "name": "Officers grabs someone by the neck then more cops pile on", "date": "2020-05-31", "date_text": "2020-05-31", "id": "il-joliet-1"}, {"links": [{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfRZkKR9l3w", "text": ""}], "state": "Illinois", "edit_at": "https://github.com/2020PB/police-brutality/blob/main/reports/Illinois.md", "city": "Rockford", "description": "An individual in a stopped car gets out and yells at police, ostensibly about the road closure by police vehicles.

At least one arrestee alleges that protesters were given explicit permission to remain past the curfew, then arrested for being out after curfew. Many arrestees say they were released in the middle of the night, without transportation home, in unfamiliar parts of the city.\n\nSeveral arrestees describe police sexually harassing/assaulting them; other arrestees corroborate these accounts. Two arrestees report that processing of arrestees on their bus was delayed because they requested medical attention and other improvements in their conditions, which would constitute first-amendment-protected speech. Four other arrestees report that processing of arrestees on their bus was delayed because some arrestees removed unsafely-tight zip ties using a lighter. All arrestees who have shared accounts mention officers behaving in a mocking, condescending, and unprofessional manner. One arrestee recalls asking officers to turn on bodycams, and officers refusing to do so. If true, this would be a clear violation of LAPD policy. One arrestee allegedly should have been exempt from the curfew as they were returning home from work.\n\nA lawsuit has been filed in connection with these and other abuses by the National Lawyers' Guild.

He alleges that a police officer told him he could finish his work. The Instagram video begins at some later point as several cops approach. They tell Walker (and at least two other persons present) to \"get inside.\" For around 12 seconds, two police officers, Walker, and one other tattoo shop employee are talking simultaneously; Walker told local news he tried to go inside but one officer blocked his path. One officer can be heard to say \"I'm giving you a chance, go in,\" then another can be heard to say \"That's exactly what's going to happen -- no -- no no -- inside, go inside, inside -- go inside, there's no debate -- no, you may not.\" Said officer then begins arresting Walker. Officers shove Walker against a wall and grab his arms; they yell for him to put his hands behind his back. One officer draws a taser and holds it near Walker's shoulder. Meanwhile, one of Walker's colleagues is filming; police scream at her to \"get the fuck back -- get back.\" It's unclear whether she's standing in a doorway or backed up against a wall. Another officer is acting very aggressively and has his taser drawn until the cop next to him taps him on the arm, at which point he holsters his taser and steps back. In total, at least eight police officers are present, of whom at least two draw their tasers, despite facing little to no resistance.\n\nNOTE: While curfews in many cities exempted anyone going to or from work, Cincinnati's exempted only essential workers. Tattoo artists are not essential, so Walker's arrest was likely lawful, though officers unnecessarily escalated the situation as they were arresting him.", "tags": ["abuse-of-power", "arrest", "bystander", "less-lethal", "taser"], "geolocation": "39.1059716, -84.5171367", "name": "Tattoo artist arrested while painting the outside of his shop; police fail to deescalate", "date": "2020-05-31", "date_text": "2020-05-31", "id": "oh-cincinnati-6"}, {"links": [{"url": "https://twitter.com/nswartsell/status/1267612155840528385", "text": ""}], "state": "Ohio", "edit_at": "https://github.com/2020PB/police-brutality/blob/main/reports/Ohio.md", "city": "Cincinnati", "description": "Video shows multiple police seizing a reporter and forcing him to the ground.
