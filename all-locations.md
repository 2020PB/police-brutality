### Police arrest two reporters | June 3

Police arrested two AL.com journalists covering a protest at 7:35 on June 3. There was a 7PM curfew in effect, which exempted journalists who were carrying a letter from their media outlet; both arrested journalists were carrying such a letter and had press lanyards. Both journalists were released shortly thereafter; while in custody, they were photographed. Birmingham police later said that the arrest was made for the journalists' safety.

### Police arrest journalist Michael Harriot | June 4

Journalist Michael Harriot was covering a protest with a group of journalists; he was the only black journalist present. He left his press pass in the car for fear of being targeted by protesters, but he says he had a digital press pass on his phone.

Around six officers arrested Harriot. Per AL.com, Harriot "was asked if he could show credentials but said he did not have any with him;" per Harriot, "officers said they couldn’t let me have my phone to show my digital credentials;" he "told them they could just call the mayor’s office to verify my media credentials; they did not attempt to." Per AL.com, "the department’s public information officer... said he \[asked Harriot\] if there was anyway \[_sic_\] to make contact with his company to confirm he was media and Harriot said no."

According to Harriot, after being arrested, he and the other arrestees were taken to a nearby area; while he waited there, an officer tightened his zip ties so tight that he lost feeling in his hands and they swelled up. Officers had trouble getting the zip ties off; they had to use a pocket knife in addition to the usual tool. Harriot was also interviewed by two agents claiming to be from the FBI.

### Officers arrest dozens of people, fail to exhibit probable cause | May 30th

Officers arrested 114 people on Saturday, May 30, most for rioting (a low-level felony). The probable cause statements submitted to the court by police justifying the arrests of many defendants were identical from one defendant to another, and alleged only that a crowd of people had engaged in criminal activity, without alleging that the particular defendant arrested had engaged in criminal activity. One defendant, a DACA recipient, was transferred to ICE custody despite a judge finding that her arrest lacked probable cause. She has since been released.

### Officer arrests a woman on the sidewalk outside her home for curfew violation | May 31st

On May 31, police forced protesters who were out after curfew into the Garfield neighborhood using tear gas and other means. Police then began arresting protesters in the Garfield neighborhood en masse. Officers approached Elizabeth Lemay, who was not part of the protests and was standing on the sidewalk outside her home. They tried to arrest her and tackled her in the process. She told the officers "I live here" and "I'm allowed to be on my own property;" the officer responded (in a cheerful tone of voice) "You're on the sidewalk. You guys think you know. You think you know everything."

Several other residents of the Garfield neighborhood have complained of police behavior that night, including one who says she passed out in her yard due to a tear-gas-induced asthma attack and awoke to find an officer handcuffing her.

### Police pepper spray protestors on sidewalk | June 27th

On June 27th, protestors gathered on the sidewalk for a 'chalk walk' protest.

Full footage from instagram shows police chasing, tackling, kneeling on and arresting a protestor. Police refused to answer when protestors asked why they were being arrested. At 2:20 in the instagram video, the filmer asks why the protestor was tased, but this appears to be erroneous; the protestor was pepper-sprayed.

Police then attempted to clear the protestors from the sidewalk into the lawn of a shopping center. One protestor remained seated and police manhandled her.

Several protestors, including the filmer, shouted at the police for treating the protestor roughly. The officer then told these protestors to back up. They obeyed. The officer then pepper sprayed them repeatedly as they walked away. Police continued to harass protestors, pushing them from the sidewalk to the lawn. It is unclear why police asserted the sidewalk was an unacceptable place to stand.

From an article in the Arizona Mirror, Tempe police are allowed to use pepper spray "against violent or non-compliant subjects, and on vicious animals." In addition, they must give verbal warning that they will escalate. No such warning was given.

## Bentonville

### Law enforcement tear-gas a crowd chanting “we want peace” right after exiting the building. | June 1st

A crowd gathered on the Bentonville Square to protest. Around 9 PM, law enforcement gassed a crowd chanting “we want peace.” Local news says some people were throwing water bottles and firecrackers. Police also claim rocks were thrown. Police claim that at least one police vehicle was damaged. Local news reports vary -- some reports have protesters "kicking" a police vehicle; some televised reports have protesters "damaging" a police vehicle; most written articles merely report that police say protesters damaged a police vehicle.

It is unclear whether any order to disperse was given before the first use of tear gas; in the videos purporting to be from that time, no such order is audible. (In one video -- see third link -- a voice can be heard that sounds like it comes from a PA system, but the words are unclear.) Several people present, including one op-ed writer, claim not to have heard any such order. Orders to disperse were certainly given repeatedly between 9:00 and 11:00, as police continued to deploy tear gas.

Police posted on the City of Bentonville Facebook page that rubber bullets were not used. Police did, in fact, use rubber bullets (per 5 News); per the op ed, the police chief attributed the error to a "communication failure."

### Beverly Hills police use LRAD (sound cannon) at protest | June 26th

During a peaceful protest in Beverly Hills, police used the dispersal function of a LRAD (or sound cannon) on protestors. Footage is pointed at the ground, but audio shows individuals arguing. The LRAD's characteristic dispersal signal is used twice, each time without warning and for about 30 seconds. In addition, a photojournalist at the scene confirms the LRAD was used.

Due to its high risk of permanent injury, indiscriminate damage, and insufficient testing surrounding long-terms effects, the use of the LRAD dispersal function is considered to be police brutality in and of itself.

## Gustine

### Protesters attacked; police shake hands of attackers; tell protesters to wait in patrol cars | June 28th

About twenty anti-BLM protesters (holding a thin blue line flag and affiliated with California Valley Patriots (CVP)) were holding a rally in Gustine California (at the corner of Grove Avenue and 5th Street). A group of around 3 young people decided to hold an impromptu counter-protest, and parked across the street from the CVP protesters. CVP protesters came across the street and began shouting at the counter-protesters. Some time later, video shows one counter-protester on the ground, on the CVP proesters' side of the street, being beaten by CVP protesters. Another counter-protester is trying to intervene but being physically restrained by CVP protesters; a third is filming the incident as CVP protesters heckle her. Photos taken after the incident show at least two of the protesters badly beaten. Each side says the other started the altercation.

Police arrived shortly thereafter. They told the counter-protesters to wait in police cars (allegedly for their own protection); the counter-protesters say they were kept in police cars for nearly an hour. The CVP protesters were not put into police cars. One counter-protester says that counter-protesters tried to leave multiple times, but were told that they were not free to go. Police can be seen shaking the hand of one of the CVP protesters; counter-protesters claim police were somewhat dismissive of their allegations of assault against the CVP protesters. No arrests were made, but a report concerning the incident has been referred to the DA.

Police fire projectiles - the filmer claims, based on a livestreamer's feed, that they are rubber bullets - at a small group of protestors from across an intersection. Police then take the intersection and march down the street, continuing to fire at protestors. At one point, another bystander asks the filmer who the police are shooting at.

### Police arrest protesters en masse and detain them in poor conditions | June 1st

Police arrested protesters en masse in downtown Los Angeles. Protesters hands were zip tied excessively tightly behind their backs and they were loaded onto buses and driven around the city. Some were taken to a temporary field jail at UCLA's Jackie Robinson stadium; UCLA claims it "failed to stop" LAPD from using the stadium as a "staging area," but was not told about the field jail until after the fact. Arestees were detained for long periods, still in excessively tight zip ties. Social distancing procedures were not observed.

Many protesters allege that conditions in the makeshift jails were poor -- detainees denied medical attention and permission to use the restroom, for instance -- and that they were released, many with dead phones, in unfamiliar places in the middle of the night with no way to get home. Two arrestees allege that police prevented them from leaving before the curfew went into effect, then arrested them for violating the curfew. One arrestee alleges that she was twice threatened with guns, that she was sexually assaulted by police, and that police mocked detainees having panic attacks. Police also allegedly arrested at least one homeless person (to whom the curfew was not supposed to apply) for a curfew violation.

A lawsuit has been filed in connection with these and other abuses by the National Lawyers' Guild; a separate lawsuit has been filed by one of the arrestees. (See also incidents ca-losangeles-32 (near-identical behavior the following day) and ca-santamonica-2 (similar behavior in Santa Monica).)

### Police arrest protesters en masse and detain them in poor conditions | June 2nd

Police arrested protesters en masse near the home of LA mayor Eric Garcetti and in other parts of the city, zip tied their hands, and held them for extended periods without appropriate social distancing. At least one arrestee alleges that protesters were given explicit permission to remain past the curfew, then arrested for being out after curfew. Many arrestees say they were released in the middle of the night, without transportation home, in unfamiliar parts of the city.

Several arrestees describe police sexually harassing/assaulting them; other arrestees corroborate these accounts. Two arrestees report that processing of arrestees on their bus was delayed because they requested medical attention and other improvements in their conditions, which would constitute first-amendment-protected speech. Four other arrestees report that processing of arrestees on their bus was delayed because some arrestees removed unsafely-tight zip ties using a lighter. All arrestees who have shared accounts mention officers behaving in a mocking, condescending, and unprofessional manner. One arrestee recalls asking officers to turn on bodycams, and officers refusing to do so. If true, this would be a clear violation of LAPD policy. One arrestee allegedly should have been exempt from the curfew as they were returning home from work.

A lawsuit has been filed in connection with these and other abuses by the National Lawyers' Guild. (See also incidents ca-losangeles-19 (near-identical behavior the previous day) and ca-santamonica-2 (similar behavior in Santa Monica).)

### Police arrest protesters en masse, confine them for long periods, and improperly zip tie them | May 31st

On May 31st, police arrested numerous protesters for curfew violations. These protesters were zip tied and held for long periods, in tight quarters which did not permit social distancing, then released late at night with no way to get home. At least one detainee alleges that detainees were denied medical care and permission to use the restroom.

Zip ties were put on too tight. Police attempted to remove zip ties with a long knife (which is not the appropriate tool). This led to multiple protesters being injured, including one who required 21 stitches; it seems unlikely that the knife was appropriately sterilized between uses, raising the possibility of bloodborne pathogen transmission.

(See also incidents ca-losangeles-19 and ca-losangeles-32 (similar behavior in Los Angeles). Note that the final link incorrectly states that the incident it describes was perpetrated by LAPD; in fact, as several commenters pointed out, it was perpetrated by Santa Monica PD, though there are allegations of similar conduct by the LAPD.)

## Vallejo

### Police fatally shoot unarmed 22 year old | June 1st

Police in northern California fatally shot an unarmed 22-year-old who was on his knees with his hands up outside a Walgreens store while responding to a call of alleged looting, officials said... An officer in the city of Vallejo was inside his car when he shot Sean Monterrosa on Monday night amid local and national protests against police brutality. Police said an officer mistakenly believed Monterrosa had a gun, but later determined he had a hammer in his pocket... 'When confronted by the police, he dropped to his knees and surrendered, and they fired at him,' said Melissa Nold, a Vallejo civil rights attorney representing Monterrosa’s family.

Six officers fired 55 bullets in 3.5 seconds; police investigation determined this use of force 'reasonable.'

Vallejo PD has posted composite video containing body cam footage, radio chatter with Dispatch and prior footage of Walgreen's security cameras being destroyed. This footage shows a car with alleged looters peeling out of the Walgreens as police arrive; this car strikes an unmarked police vehicle and continues. Police open the doors of their unmarked van and fire on Monterrosa immediately and without warning. They state that they believed Monterrosa was armed, thought it turned out to be only a hammer.

### Armored law enforcement vehicle threatens protestors, deploys tear gas on highway | June 1st

In this video, an armored law enforcement vehicle tells protestors blocking a highway to disperse over megaphone. It sounds like the operator is saying "if you do not move, you will be dead," but video later released by the police department seems to show that the operator instead said "if you do not move, you will be gassed." The protesters do not move; the officers deploy tear gas, coating the highway in dense, opaque clouds of blinding fog. Vehicles are seen waiting to continue on their way; it is unclear whether these vehicles attempted to navigate the clouds of tear gas. (Note: Jalopnik reports that this happened on June 2; however, protests consistent with the video were only reported on June 1, and other sources place the video on June 1.)

### Police arrest man using excessive force, dogs | June 1st

Police threw tear gas at protesters blocking a roadway in an effort to disperse them. One protester, Joseph Malott, allegedly threw a tear gas canister back at police. Police arrested him for (per Mercury News) “assaulting a police officer with a deadly weapon.” During the arrest, Malott was bitten and scratched repeatedly by a police dog, leaving bite marks and scratches all over his back and a wound on his leg which required 10 stitches. During the arrest, he says he was slammed against a fence then thrown to the ground, and recalls thinking “when are they going to take the dogs off me?”

### Multiple cops pin man to ground while repeatedly punching him | June 1st

Police officers tell a man standing in an intersection to get on the ground then shoot him (apparently with rubber bullets). He falls to the ground. He attempts to get up; an officer tackles him. At least 5 cops pin him down. Several of them punch him repeatedly even though he appears to not be resisting. At one point a bystander says "yeah, punch him again -- I'm filming you!"

Title on Reddit states that the protestor suffered permanent hearing loss, but this has not been verified.

It should be noted that these rounds are intended to be shot at the ground as the officer did. However, the proximity of the shot to protestors severely increased the risk of injury, as seen here.

Footage was first posted on reddit.com/r/protest on June 5th.

### Police use excessive force to clear protestor tent encampment | July 1st

The first clip is a livestream from the night of the dispersal. Police standoff begins around 1:28:00. Police begin by snatching and grabbing protestors to arrest. Then a scuffle breaks out, the camera pans to show an officer striking protestors with his baton. Another officer approaches and pepper-sprays protestors. A third officer fires a riot gun, containing either pepper balls or paintballs, at protestors. Police then tear gas the area while protestors flee. At 1:34:00, police arrest a medic. At 1:38:00, police advance towards the protestors again, pushing them off the sidewalk to the far side of the street. A shot can be heard, then a scream. The camera pans to show a scuffle between police and protestors. Police then use pepper-spray and riot rounds to force protestors back. A protestor is arrested. The arrest takes several minutes and it appears that police kneel on the woman's neck while making the arrest. At 1:51:00, one officer is shown without a badge number or body cam. The filmer then looks at several other officers.

The third link shows another angle on the incident at 1:28:00.

The fourth link shows another angle on the incident at 1:38:00. In addition, the caption states that police were using pepper balls.

## Waterbury

### Police tackle and detain 6 protestors | May 31st

Waterbury police detain at least 6 people at an assembly at the intersection of Wolcott St. and Long Hill Rd., apparently for blocking the road. Police had warned protesters several times that if they remained on Wolcott St., they would be arrested. Police tackle multiple protesters, including one (who one post claims is 15 years old) who is thrown to the ground and pinned down for an extended period, with one officer kneeling on him, in what appears to be excessive force. A dog is present, but apparently not used. Waterbury authorities say no property was damaged during the protest. Arrested protesters were not charged.

### Police detain protesters | May 31st

A group of people are protesting outside Waterbury police headquarters around 5:30PM. Police are lined up blocking the roadway; they warn protesters to clear the roadway. Police declare the assembly unlawful, apparently in response to the protesters standing in the roadway. Police again warn protesters to clear the roadway, and say that anyone in the roadway will be arrested. A woman steps out into the street, walking slowly across holding a sign. Police tell her to get out of the roadway; she continues across to the other side. Police move forward and arrest numerous protesters, several of whom do not appear to have been in the roadway to begin with. Several protesters are forced to the ground, including one who is slammed against a police car (see second link). Later in the same incident (around 6:30 in the first link), police aggressively and without apparent reason arrest another protester. An LRAD is mentioned, but apparently not deployed. Waterbury authorities say no property was damaged during the protest. Arrested protesters were not charged. (Note: this is a different incident from ct-waterbury-2 -- see street view.)

### Police laugh and joke when they think their body cams are off | May 31st

Body cam video released by Fort Lauderdale PD on Youtube shows police laughing and joking after shooting protesters with rubber bullets and tear gas. They are speaking candidly to one another because they mistakenly believe their cams are in "standby" mode and not recording. Policing experts who reviewed the footage say that the behavior is unprofessional and that the officers felt "comfortable about talking about turning the camera off." At 2:55, a cop can be heard saying "if you need it, give me a target." The Miami Herald quotes a retired Lieutenant Colonel as commenting, "If you're not seeing a threat, why are you asking for a threat? That would almost lead you to believe that they were indiscriminately firing."

### Police officer grabs arrestee's breast; police violently arrest protestor | July 1st

Footage shows police arresting a woman. A man who walked nearby with his hands up is thrown to the ground by two officers and arrested.

Additional footage shows an officer grabbing the breast of the woman arrested. It should be noted that police use an "open hand" frisking technique to check along the breasts during an arrest. However the officer does not appear to be using an open hand and appears to be grabbing the woman, rather than frisking her. While having a male officer frisk a female protestor without warning is another subject of controversy, this incident appears to even be outside the bounds of "proper conduct" according to police guidelines.

### Sheriff scuffles with protestor over "F\*ck Trump" sign | June 3rd

Lowndes County sheriff, Ashley Paulk, confiscated a "F\*ck Trump" sign from a protestor, citing it as "evidence" for a crime not stated, in itself a violation of 1st Amendment rights. The woman attempted to grab the sign back and the sheriff choked her in response, before protestors separated the two.

In a later statement, the sheriff said he would continue to charge protestors carrying posters with profanity with misdemeanor disorderly conduct, in violation of Supreme Court case [Cohen v. California](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7398433541275578772&q=cohen+v.+california&hl=en&as_sdt=3,39) which ruled a man wearing a "Fuck the Draft" jacket could not be convicted for disturbing the peace. In addition, a [Georgia supreme court case](https://law.justia.com/cases/georgia/supreme-court/2017/s17a1040.html) cleared a man charged with disorderly conduct for raising his middle finger in a church. The sheriff cited a Georgia law allowing misdemeanor charges for profanity in the presence of an individual under 14 years of age.

In the background of the second clip, a police cruiser marked "Valdosta" can be seen, establishing the location.

### Sheriff arrests woman for sign containing profanity | June 4th

In a continuation of events from June 3rd (ga-valdosta-1), sheriff Ashley Paulk arrested a woman carrying a sign suggestive of a "lewd act" between Paulk and Donald Trump, fulfilling his threat to arrest protestors carrying signs containing profanity. He cited a Georgia law allowing misdemeanor charges for profanity in the presence of an individual under 14 years of age, despite [U.S. Supreme Court cases](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7398433541275578772&q=cohen+v.+california&hl=en&as_sdt=3,39) and [Georgia Supreme Court cases](https://law.justia.com/cases/georgia/supreme-court/2017/s17a1040.html) exonerating individuals charged with similar crimes.

### Police pull black women out of the car and throw them to the ground | May 31st

Police are seen attacking a car and pulling two black women out of a car and shoving them to the ground (unclear motive). Block Club Chicago states the victims were detained for disorderly conduct and that police drove off with one of the victims in the car, leaving the other two in the lot.

Victim states that officers kneeled on her neck, that shards of glass from her broken window lacerated her face, and that an officer called her "a f---- savage." In addition, she states she was not given access to an attorney and was not allowed a phone call for 6 hours.

After release (with neither charges nor explanation), the victim attempted to file a complaint but was told the complaint line was unnaccesible.

This was reported to have happened at "2600 N. Narragansett Ave.", but 2700 N seems slightly more accurate. Google Streetview at that address shows the same "Show Carnival" store seen in the video.

### Police break up a small protest and shoots at them as they leave | June 14th

There is a very small protest of what appears to be no more than 15 people. Police arrive declaring it an unlawful assembly. Some of the protestors, including the person filming, go into a nearby restaurant because their car was in the direction of the police and they did not feel comfortable walking towards them. Two militarized police come into the restaurant and make them exit. The police tell them to run, motioning with their hands in the direction away from the protestor's car, despite the protestor trying to explain that they need to go in the other direction to actually leave. They run as they are told, and say they have their hands up. It then appears the police fire rubber bullets at them, the camera was facing away from the police but it picks up the sounds. The video is in two parts and includes further context via subtitles.

### Police push, shove and pepper-spray protestors | June 22nd

First person footage of a protest shows police forcing protestors down a sidewalk. It is unclear why police determined protestors could not continue to protest peacefully at the point of the sidewalk.

Police use their shields to shove protestors along. Footage is dark and a little unclear, but it appears that around 2 minutes, the filmer and her sisters are pepper-sprayed. They scream in pain and the filmer states repeatedly that she cannot see. The filmer then loses track of her sisters. She finds one family member around 4 minutes, who shows clear signs of having been pepper sprayed.

The filmer and her sister attempted to regroup and find their third family member, but police continued to shove them along.

Around 4:15 a protestor is shoved to the ground. She can be heard screaming, "My leg, my leg."

After this, footage cuts to a shot of the filmer turns the camera on herself and her eyes are watering, showing clear indication of pepper spray. It is unclear if this is from the first round of pepper spray or she has been sprayed a second time. Medics attempt to assist her but are forced to continue marching while doing so. Around 7 minutes, medics help her into a car. She is treated for the duration of the footage.

Additional links from a reporter discuss the tactics used by police to intimidate and harass protestors. They also capture the aftermath of the pepper-spraying.

### Police arrest 17 people during a peaceful protest for Black Lives Matter at the State Capitol | July 1st

Black Lives Matter advocates gathered at the Capitol to lobby for the governor to sign an executive order restoring felon voting rights by Saturday, July 4.

White protestors were inside the Capitol, police identified some of them claimed to have vandalized police car in the past, and arrests were made inside the Capitol for those individuals. However, the arrested individuals declined the allegations. The protestors followed the police outside the Capitol, and one of the protestors blocked their path and later the crowd tried to pull the arrestees from the custody of the police officers. That is when more crowds and police started to get involved. Police used pepper spray to help disperse the crowd and arrested 17 people, including two juveniles.

### Restaurant owner shot and killed | June 1st

LMPD and KY National Guard were sent to 26th and Broadway to disperse a gathering (unrelated to protests) in violation of curfew. Police officer Katie Crews crosses the street and begins firing pepper balls at a group standing outside. A pepper ball hit the doorway of YaYa's BBQ (the victim's business), nearly striking his niece. He went outside and appears to fire a single shot into the air. He steps inside and then steps back out and is shot and killed by police and guardsman. Officers were required to wear bodycams and have them activated as a reform after the police killing of Breonna Taylor, but of the 20 officers on scene, LMPD claims 0 were using their bodycams.

### LMPD Bearcat strikes vehicle; police initially state vehicle hit them, then retract the statement; in addition, bystander filming is arrested | July 1st

On July 1st, a collision was reported between a bystander vehicle and an LMPD armored car, also called a Bearcat. Police initially stated that the Bearcat was rammed by a protestor vehicle. They later retracted this statement, saying that in fact the Bearcat hit the vehicle. It is not clear if the vehicle was related to the protest at all. However, police state that they intentionally hit the vehicle to prevent further harm, stating that they recognized the vehicle from an incident the previous night.

A woman filming the incident from her car stepped out and asked someone for their name. She was then arrested.

Additional footage from a bystander shows the filmer running out of the way of the Bearcat to avoid being hit.

### Police target independent journalists and livestreamers for second consecutive night | July 1st

Footage from two livestreamers on July 1st shows their arrests. LMPD arrested livestreamers the previous night as well. It should be noted that these independent journalists are not always credentialed, but they are known for releasing full, unedited footage of the protests.

The ACLU has raised concerns that these arrests are inhibiting freedom of the press, while Louisville Metropolitan Police Department has stated that the department "has no issue with anyone livestreaming. But many of those livestreaming are also protesting. And anyone protesting who fails to follow police orders to disperse may be arrested."

The journalist from MilkyMess TV took 1st person footage of their arrest. Around 1:50:00 in her Facebook live post, she is wandering around a crowd of protestors on the sidewalk. The journalist does not appear to be chanting or singing with protestors. Several police cruisers pull up and officers step out. The journalist steps forward to get a better look and is arrested without a word. The camera is knocked from her hand.

An additional livestream from a reporter affiliated with WDRB News shows the incident. Beginning at 3:05:00, police arrive, appear to single out MilkyMess and tackle her to the ground. The reporter asks why she is being arrested. A police officer says, "Trespassing." It should be noted that MilkyMess was on a public sidewalk and numerous other individuals were not arrested. Around 3:11:00, the WDRB reporter walks over to another arrestee. Shortly after, the reporter asks an officer if he should be in the street or sidewalk. The officer tells him he's "gotta go." The reporter crosses to the other side of the street and asks another person if there were arrests. The individual says there was one arrest. This totals 3 arrests for trespassing on a park/public sidewalk out of a group of 30-40 individuals.

### Police respond to splashed water with excessive force | July 7th

Police are attempting to tow a car and protestors have gathered around in opposition. A protestor splashes water on an officer and attempts to run away. The officer chases her, holds her in a headlock, and forces her to the ground with the aid of several other officers. One officer kneels on the protestor to arrest her while other officers hold the crowd back. One officer can be heard saying repeatedly saying, "Back the fuck off."

The filmer also posted a screenshot, alleging that the protestor was charged with disorderly conduct, possession of marijuana, inciting a riot, and third degree assault of an officer. Third degree assault is generally classified as the intent to cause serious bodily harm, generally with a deadly weapon. The filmer is a journalist with the Courier Journal and is verified on Twitter, lending some credence to her allegations about the charges.

### Police charge protestors and press | June 2nd

Police line is seen using shields to push back a small group of protestors. The filmer, a reporter, moves around to the other side of the protestors. At this point, the footage captures another group of police officers charging the protestors from behind without warning.

The footage becomes blurry as it appears that police strike the reporter, who repeatedly states, "I am press," and is standing alongside several camera crews.

The reporter states that they were beaten by police, their glasses were broken, and their phone thrown. In a subsequent video, the reporter speaks to the police chief and states in the description that they were pepper-sprayed. The police chief states that he will open an investigation. A second reporter off-screen tells the chief that multiple journalists were assaulted.

### Police use LRAD (sound cannon) to disperse protestors | June 2nd

Video shows sound cannon deployed alongside APC. The LRAD can be heard with its characteristic alarm.

The use of LRADs is a subject of much contention, with frequent reports of permanent nerve and hearing damage caused by their use.

The ACLU's [position](https://www.aclu.org/fact-sheet/acoustic-weapons-fact-sheet) is that due to the high risk of damage and lack of research on lasting effects, LRADs should not be deployed to disperse protests.

### Police shove elderly man, causing him to fall and hit the back of his head | June 4th

Two police officers shove an unarmed, elderly man ([reportedly 75 years old](https://twitter.com/HannahBuehler/status/1268742666210226177)), who falls backwards and strikes his head on the concrete sidewalk. He appears to begin bleeding from his ear and passes out.

Buffalo P.D. released an official statement saying that he "tripped and fell." After video of the incident surfaced, however, both officers were suspended, an internal affairs investigation was opened, and both officers were charged with assault. In response to the suspension, the Buffalo Emergency Response Team [resigned from their posts](https://nypost.com/2020/06/05/buffalo-emergency-response-team-quits-in-solidarity-of-cops/). At first, the two officers were suspended without pay, but because the Buffalo police contract only allows suspension without pay for 30 days, they are now (as of July 10) suspended with pay.

The man suffered brain damage and has begun physical therapy.

Another NYPD SUV drives up alongside the first, then drives through the crowd, forcing protesters out of its way. The first car then drives forward, ramming the dense crowd of civilians in front of it. NYPD's internal affairs bureau conducted a review and found no wrongdoing. The police commissioner said that "preliminarily we have an accounting of that incident where we have officers in a situation where they're essentially being penned in by protesters," but it seems from the video as though, throughout the incident, both cars have a clear route of escape behind them.

### Protestors detained more than 24 hours by police; upheld by NY Judge | June 4th

The Legal Aid Society, a law firm for low-income families and individuals, filed an emergency lawsuit after learning protestors had been detained for over 24 hours without arraignment, in violation of New York state law.

A New York state judge rejected the appeal, allowing the NYPD to continue holding protestors, citing the virtual arraignments made necessary by the COVID-19 pandemic as a cause of slower processing. However, the Legal Aid Society states that conditions are not suitable for social distancing in the holding cells, thus risking an increased spread of COVID-19.

The NY Daily News cited that as of Thursday, June 4th, 202 people had been detained for over 24 hours.

### Police target, follow and arrest protestor | June 4th

On June 4th, Conrad James, a prominent protestor in Raleigh, threatened to file a class action lawsuit against the Raleigh police departments.

In the early hours of the morning on June 5th, men in black, without visible badge numbers, raided James' home and arrested him for allegedly failing to return a rental car. James denies these claims. The arrest took place in a county under the jurisdiction of the Wake County Sheriff's Office and the Fuquay-Varina Police Department. The sheriff's office, the Fuquay-Varina Police, and the Raleigh Police give differing accounts about the departments involved and the time at which the raid took place.

Police scanner audio shows that Raleigh police officers were following him during protests later that day.

### Raleigh police roughly arrest protestors | June 18th

Footage shows violent arrests of 2 protestors. Multiple officers grab the individuals, shoving and pulling them. The officers also shove numerous protestors out of the way.

One of the arrestees was a minor and charges were not filed against them. Police later dropped charges against the adult protestor.

Police claimed the individuals were blocking the street, but presented no supporting footage and the lack of charges casts doubt on the claim. A tweet from the police states the juvenile protestor was arrested for Assault of an officer, while the adult was arrested for resist, delay and obstruct.

### Man struck by counter-protestor while police look on | June 14th

During a BLM protest in Bethel, Ohio, protestors were met by a substantial counter-protest, which allegedly harrassed and assaulted them. In one particular video, a counter-protestor strikes a BLM protestor on the back of the head and walk away. There are police officers directly in front of and behind the incident. The man tells the officer he just got punched. The officer's response is difficult to hear above the crowd, but he appears to offer little help, instead telling the protestor he is not allowed to demonstrate there (on a public sidewalk).

News report includes footage of counter-protestors using racial slurs, harassing protestors and rip signs out of protestor hands while police look on.

### Tattoo artist arrested while painting the outside of his shop; police fail to deescalate | May 31st

Jamison Walker, a Cincinnati tattoo artist, with the owner's permission, was painting the outside of the shop where he works after curfew. He alleges that a police officer told him he could finish his work. The Instagram video begins at some later point as several cops approach. They tell Walker (and at least two other persons present) to "get inside." For around 12 seconds, two police officers, Walker, and one other tattoo shop employee are talking simultaneously; Walker told local news he tried to go inside but one officer blocked his path. One officer can be heard to say "I'm giving you a chance, go in," then another can be heard to say "That's exactly what's going to happen -- no -- no no -- inside, go inside, inside -- go inside, there's no debate -- no, you may not." Said officer then begins arresting Walker. Officers shove Walker against a wall and grab his arms; they yell for him to put his hands behind his back. One officer draws a taser and holds it near Walker's shoulder. Meanwhile, one of Walker's colleagues is filming; police scream at her to "get the fuck back -- get back." It's unclear whether she's standing in a doorway or backed up against a wall. Another officer is acting very aggressively and has his taser drawn until the cop next to him taps him on the arm, at which point he holsters his taser and steps back. In total, at least eight police officers are present, of whom at least two draw their tasers, despite facing little to no resistance.

NOTE: While curfews in many cities exempted anyone going to or from work, Cincinnati's exempted only essential workers. Tattoo artists are not essential, so Walker's arrest was likely lawful, though officers unnecessarily escalated the situation as they were arresting him.

### Philadelphia Police Trap Protesters on Highway, Then Tear Gas Them and Shoot Rubber Bullets | June 1st

An estimated 3000-5000 protesters moved onto Interstate 676, stopping traffic. Protesters move into a tunnel under 20th street. An eye-witness states that officers inside the tunnel (eastbound on I-676) began shooting rubber bullets and macing protesters without any warning or any instructions to halt the protest on the highway. Protesters clear the tunnel, many kneel and put their hands up. Police shoot tear gas at protesters to disperse the crowd, they escape to the hill between 20th and 21st street as there was tear gas westbound on the interstate and they were still being fired at by officers in the tunnel to the east. Some throw canisters back. Officers chase protesters up the hill and appear to detain a number of them. Other officers continue to fire tear gas on to the hill, despite the only visible escape from the tear gas being over a ~10 ft fence.

### Police tear-gas, shoot and arrest protestor confused by contradicting police instructions | May 30th

John Connors, a protestor in Pittsburgh on Saturday, May 30th, was recording the protest on his phone, when police told him to leave the area or risk arrest. He is heard asking which direction to go. The direction given was already blocked off, so he asked for more clarity. He was given additional instructions and made his way towards a 7/11.

He asks an officer, "Are you guys police officers or are you guys cops?" The officer then release a tear gas canister at his feet and shoots him at short range. Police then arrest Connors. Connors admits his question was antagonizing, but states he did nothing to threaten officers or escalate to violence, which is supported by the footage.

### Sheriffs tear gas crowd after accidental vandalism | May 31st

Footage from the first link shows two protestors attempting to remove a sign strung between two lampposts on a mezzanine. The lampposts fall over during this process. Then at 00:40, officers rush out of the building, seizing protestors.

The second clip shows officers with rifles making arrests on the mezzanine. Officers then pull what appear to be service pistols and point them at protestors. More officers step out of the building onto the mezzanine and take the staircase. Protestors and police face each other at the foot of the stairs. Protestors begin chanting.

The third clip shows police dropping tear gas canisters from the mezzanine. Protestors flee.

The fourth clip shows protestors attempt to recover their belongings while police launch more tear gas. Protestors flee to the far sidewalk as police move into the street.

An article from the Chattanoogan states Sheriffs threw the tear gas, not Chattanooga police.

### Police use horses as weapons | May 30th

In an attempt to clear protestors blocking a road, mounted police began walking their horses into protestors. A handful of protestors refused to move. Rather than arresting the protestors and walking them away, police continued to push them with their horses. At one point, an officer pepper-sprays a protestor. After this protestors begin throwing things at police. The pepper-sprayed protestor swings his sign at the officer. The officer then grabs the protestor by the backpack and drags him down the road until other protestors intervene to free him. Another officer tramples one of these protestors. Protestors continue to shout at police for the duration of the footage.

Charges were filed against the protestor for swinging his sign at police. Police say the sign had a wooden stick attached, but footage indicates it was only a piece of cardboard, cardstock, or similar paper material.

### Officer repeatedly uses stun gun on suspect who said he couldn't breathe | June 5th

Bodycam footage shows an unarmed man walking around in the street. The man allegedly called for oxygen and appears to be in distress, with difficulty communicating his mental state or his medical needs. Another officer arrives on scene and fires his taser at the man. The officer kneels on his neck and continues to tase him. The body cam footage is covered briefly, before showing the other officer pressing his stun gun into the man's neck, then strikes him on the head with the taser. The man screams and attempts to stand. The EMTs assist the police in subduing him, while an officer places his hands in cuffs. Near the end of the footage he can be heard saying, "I can't breathe".

This footage does not appear to be protest related, but demonstrates a severe escalation in force dealing with a man not in a fit mental state.

### Officers pepper-spray Virginia state delegate peacefully protesting | May 30

In this video, delegate Lee Carter asks officers questions about their methods in the protests. He stands in the way of an advancing line of law enforcement officers; he is pushed to the ground at 1:30 and pepper-sprayed at 2:27. He also claims to have been hit by a flashbang grenade earlier in the protest (see also third link). At some point (see Facebook video), someone who seems to be the delegate shouts "I'm a member of the general assembly. I write the state police budget. They're gonna fucking regret that."

It is unclear how the protest unfolded, and why the police were advancing on the crowd wearing riot gear; police allege that the protest turned violent and some protesters say that they were tear-gassed or shot at with rubber bullets while peacefully protesting or retreating. (See fourth and fifth links.)

### Woman hit with police projectile resumes breathing after CPR, delivered to hospital | June 7th

Video shows an individual getting hit by a police projectile, falling down, and becoming unresponsive. Medics drag the person away from the police. A medic's first-hand narrative account describes the victim as "a young woman in her 20s." Medics attempt to treat the young woman while police throw flash bang grenades directly into the first aid center where they are gathered. Several times the victim stops responding or breathing but becomes responsive again after CPR. 911 could not send an ambulance. Eventually a civilian transports her by car to an Emergency Dept where she was delivered with a pulse. The person who filmed the incident from his workplace office is an editor at the local alt weekly, The Stranger; he reported in his twitter thread that the people in the office were having trouble breathing from teargas or some other chemical agent.

### Officers tackle protesters, put a knee on least one of their necks | July 2nd

Video shows bicycle cops fast approaching a group of protesters who are just outside an area cordoned off with police tape, presumably because they considered one or more of them to have crossed the boundary. Without warning, the cops tackle two protesters to the ground. Someone can be heard shouting "get your knee off their neck!" One of the videos clearly shows an officer placing his knee on the neck of one of the individuals.

### Police harass man attempting to go to his apartment | July 3rd

A man returning to his apartment is followed by a police officer. The officer asks the man where he lives. The man responds with his address. The officer is joined by a second and they ask the filmer for ID. The filmer states he does not have ID and that the Mayor said police should stop asking for ID. The police say that the order just came in to start asking for ID again. They give the filmer three options: leave the area, be arrested, or allow the police to escort him to his home. The filmer decides to leave the area.

Footage shows a handful of protestors marching in the street. Protestors clear to the sidewalks as police arrive. Officers approach the crowd and single out one black woman. At 1:58 in the Reddit link, an officer can be heard saying, "You were blocking earlier." Officers then grab her and arrest her. Additional officers brandishing tasers and pepper spray surround the arrest. Police then place the protestor in an unmarked van.

It is unclear why this individual was singled out.

### Police arrest journalist | July 10th

First person footage from a photojournalist shows the journalist filming a police car while stating that allegedly the officer in the car said that the officer has the photojournalist's address. The journalist repeats these words back, including the exact phrase, "I have your address." The officer then approaches him and arrests him for threatening an officer, alleging that the journalist claimed to have the officer's address.

The second link shows the full series of events. The photojournalist is filming police as they write parking citations. He is using strong language with the officers and harassing them. However he is doing no more than hurling insults and noting names and badge numbers. At 2:00, it can be verified that the officer does say he has the journalist's address. So, in fact, when he is arrested for threatening an officer, he is repeating the officer's words back to him.

Notably, this journalist filmed the arrest of the individual in wa-seattle-27.

### Unidentified man working alongside police hits protesters with baton | June 22nd

Video shows police slowly advancing towards protesters, pushing them back. Alongside the police is a man conspicuously wearing "jeans and fatigue-colored ammo belt" wielding a baton. He has no police badge or other identification. He hits and shoves the individual filming. Neither he nor the officers answer when protesters demand to know who the man is and whether he is a cop or a vigilante. A second video in the same twitter thread shows the unidentified man striking a protester and talking with an officer. A third video in the thread shows the man assisting with an arrest. It is unclear whether the police were allowing a civilian without any authority to assault protesters, or whether they were protecting the identity of an officer from some special unit.

He says that volunteer medics had permission from the church where they set up, but police ignored the permission and dispersed them regardless.

### Police use pepper spray, flashbangs and tear gas to disperse protest | June 23rd

Multiple videos from Raws media show police use of pepper spray, flashbangs and tear gas to disperse small, peaceful protests.

Protestors appear to have erected small barricades in the streets using traffic cones and planters. Police fire on protestors at range with flashbangs and tear gas. Then in a later video, police line can be seen chanting, "Move back," while spraying pepper spray.

The second clip from Raws shows protestors attempting to treat a fellow protestor who was injured in the first round of violence.

Additional footage posted on Youtube shows similar events. Around 4 minutes, this footage also shows police pushing a man on crutches and harassing him to move faster. Protestors attempting to help the man on crutches are assaulted.

Footage from 3 tiktok videos shows numerous officers (approximately 8) arresting one protestor. Protestor appears to passively resist by locking his arms. He says, "Sir, I will go with you if you stop grabbing my arms." Other protestors can be heard asking why the man is under arrest.

The protestor can be heard screaming in pain as police force him into cuffs. Police then lift him by his limbs and his pants to carry him away.

The third link appears to be the third in chronological order as the protestors arms are already cuffed. It is unclear why he is lying face down in the bushes at the beginning of this clip. It additionally shows the careless and physical manner of arrest used by the police.

This turns violent as an officer shoves the protestor into the concrete and is quickly aided by at least one other officer.
In the second video, four officers are shown to be directly involved in the arrest with many more barricading them with bikes to keep the crowd back. The arrest is then made with the man on the ground.

### Police on bikes restrain man using knee on neck | June 2nd

Protesters were congregating at the intersection of North 6th Street and McKinley Avenue. A group of officers on bikes rode up to them. Two officers on bikes collided with one another; one officer fell to the ground. Officers then tackled a protestor (for reasons unknown) and attempted to take him into custody, with one officer placing a knee on his neck or head for one or two minutes. No officers intervened to get the knee off the man's neck; police formed a barrier to screen the arrest from other protestors and people filming. At the same time, police arrested one other man and hit a woman in the collarbone -- again, for reasons unknown. The man who had an officer's knee on his neck has sued.

Over the course of about an hour, police moved forward, dispersing the protesters using tear gas and rubber bullets, first pushing the protesters a block and a half then pushing them off of North 6th Street entirely. Video shows police shooting rubber bullets at protesters on a sidewalk and firing gas canisters, in large number, at a small group of peaceful protesters. (At least some tear gas was used, but it is unclear how much. Police say they also used smoke canisters.)

Police claim they used force to disperse the crowd after rocks and glass were thrown at them. Police also said at the time that "Molotov cocktails" were thrown at them. They later walked that statement back to say that one Molotov Cocktail was thrown. They say it did not ignite. Media and protesters present say they saw water bottles being thrown, but not glass, rocks, or a Molotov cocktail. Video released by police clearly shows something being thrown at police, but doesn't show what it was. Police also produced a picture of a crushed water bottle and what looks like a water pump and implied it was the remnants of a Molotov cocktail.

NOTE: this incident immediately follows wi-milwaukee-2. Because the misconduct involved is substantially different, it has been given its own incident.
