### Police arrest two reporters | 2020-06-03

Police arrested two AL.com journalists covering a protest at 7:35 on June 3. There was a 7PM curfew in effect, which exempted journalists who were carrying a letter from their media outlet; both arrested journalists were carrying such a letter and had press lanyards. Both journalists were released shortly thereafter; while in custody, they were photographed. Birmingham police later said that the arrest was made for the journalists' safety.

Two employees of Alabama Media Group were restrained using zip ties.

### Police arrest journalist Michael Harriot | 2020-06-04

Journalist Michael Harriot was covering a protest with a group of journalists; he was the only black journalist present. He left his press pass in the car for fear of being targeted by protesters, but he says he had a digital press pass on his phone.

Around six officers arrested Harriot. Per AL.com, Harriot "was asked if he could show credentials but said he did not have any with him;" per Harriot, "officers said they couldn’t let me have my phone to show my digital credentials;" he "told them they could just call the mayor’s office to verify my media credentials; they did not attempt to." Per AL.com, "the department’s public information officer... said he \[asked Harriot\] if there was anyway \[_sic_\] to make contact with his company to confirm he was media and Harriot said no."

According to Harriot, after being arrested, he and the other arrestees were taken to a nearby area; while he waited there, an officer tightened his zip ties so tight that he lost feeling in his hands and they swelled up. Officers had trouble getting the zip ties off; they had to use a pocket knife in addition to the usual tool. Harriot was also interviewed by two agents claiming to be from the FBI.

### Indigenous protesters shot and tear gassed | 2020-10-12

Members of the O'odham Anti Border Collective staged a protest near Border Patrol checkpoint SR-85 in Arizona on Indigenous People's Day (October 12th). Protesters blocking the street were met with impact munitions (allegedly rubber bullets) and tear gas fired by officers from the Arizona Department of Public Safety.

Demonstrations have centered on Quitobaquito Springs, a local freshwater source along the border of Organ Pipe National Monument, part of the traditional Hia-Ced O'odham homeland. Construction of the border wall puts access to this traditional resource at risk for indigenous people living in the area.

Protesters say 8 adults were taken into custody, as well as several minors.

### Officers arrest dozens of people, fail to exhibit probable cause | 2020-05-30

Officers arrested 114 people on Saturday, May 30, most for rioting (a low-level felony). The probable cause statements submitted to the court by police justifying the arrests of many defendants were identical from one defendant to another, and alleged only that a crowd of people had engaged in criminal activity, without alleging that the particular defendant arrested had engaged in criminal activity. One defendant, a DACA recipient, was transferred to ICE custody despite a judge finding that her arrest lacked probable cause. She has since been released.

### Officer arrests a woman on the sidewalk outside her home for curfew violation | 2020-05-31

On May 31, police forced protesters who were out after curfew into the Garfield neighborhood using tear gas and other means. Police then began arresting protesters in the Garfield neighborhood en masse. Officers approached Elizabeth Lemay, who was not part of the protests and was standing on the sidewalk outside her home. They tried to arrest her and tackled her in the process. She told the officers "I live here" and "I'm allowed to be on my own property;" the officer responded (in a cheerful tone of voice) "You're on the sidewalk. You guys think you know. You think you know everything."

Several other residents of the Garfield neighborhood have complained of police behavior that night, including one who says she passed out in her yard due to a tear-gas-induced asthma attack and awoke to find an officer handcuffing her.

## Tempe

### Police pepper spray protesters on sidewalk | 2020-06-27

On June 27th, protesters gathered on the sidewalk for a 'chalk walk' protest.

Full footage from instagram shows police chasing, tackling, kneeling on and arresting a protester. Police refused to answer when protesters asked why they were being arrested. At 2:20 in the instagram video, the filmer asks why the protester was tased, but this appears to be erroneous; the protester was pepper-sprayed.

Police then attempted to clear the protesters from the sidewalk into the lawn of a shopping center. One protester remained seated and police manhandled her.

Several protesters, including the filmer, shouted at the police for treating the protester roughly. The officer then told these protesters to back up. They obeyed. The officer then pepper sprayed them repeatedly as they walked away. Police continued to harass protesters, pushing them from the sidewalk to the lawn. It is unclear why police asserted the sidewalk was an unacceptable place to stand.

From an article in the Arizona Mirror, Tempe police are allowed to use pepper spray "against violent or non-compliant subjects, and on vicious animals." In addition, they must give verbal warning that they will escalate. No such warning was given.

## Bentonville

### Law enforcement tear-gas a crowd chanting “we want peace” right after exiting the building. | 2020-06-01

A crowd gathered on the Bentonville Square to protest. Around 9 PM, law enforcement gassed a crowd chanting “we want peace.” Local news says some people were throwing water bottles and firecrackers. Police also claim rocks were thrown. Police claim that at least one police vehicle was damaged. Local news reports vary -- some reports have protesters "kicking" a police vehicle; some televised reports have protesters "damaging" a police vehicle; most written articles merely report that police say protesters damaged a police vehicle.

It is unclear whether any order to disperse was given before the first use of tear gas; in the videos purporting to be from that time, no such order is audible. (In one video -- see third link -- a voice can be heard that sounds like it comes from a PA system, but the words are unclear.) Several people present, including one op-ed writer, claim not to have heard any such order. Orders to disperse were certainly given repeatedly between 9:00 and 11:00, as police continued to deploy tear gas.

Police posted on the City of Bentonville Facebook page that rubber bullets were not used. Police did, in fact, use rubber bullets (per 5 News); per the op ed, the police chief attributed the error to a "communication failure."

### Beverly Hills police use LRAD (sound cannon) at protest | 2020-06-26

During a peaceful protest in Beverly Hills, police used the dispersal function of a LRAD (or sound cannon) on protesters. Footage is pointed at the ground, but audio shows individuals arguing. The LRAD's characteristic dispersal signal is used twice, each time without warning and for about 30 seconds. In addition, a photojournalist at the scene confirms the LRAD was used.

Due to its high risk of permanent injury, indiscriminate damage, and insufficient testing surrounding long-terms effects, the use of the LRAD dispersal function is considered to be police brutality in and of itself.

### Sheriff's Deputies fire less-lethal rounds, tear gas at protesters | 2020-06-21

Several thousand protesters marched on Father's Day from the site of Los Angeles Sheriff's Department shooting of Andrés Guardado on June 18 to the Los Angeles Sheriff's station in Compton. Andrés' father addressed the crowd in English and in Spanish. Deputies in riot gear pointed guns at protesters who chanted "put down your guns." A Sheriff Department helicopter flew overhead urging local residents who had joined the march to leave and go home so that they would not be tear-gassed when outside agitators were dealt with. Black protesters and protest leaders shared hugs with Guardado's family to show solidarity between the Black and Latino communities. As a few mothers of children slain by LAPD or LASD told their stories, a group of protesters split off to confront a second band of Deputies in riot gear. One protester yelled "F*** the police!" The deputies opened fire with non-lethal rounds, tear gas, and flash bangs.

Footage shows scattered protesters on pedestrian walkway with deputies firing tear gas around them. Additional footage shows protesters helping one another recover from the damage.

A journalist states they were tear-gassed while holding up their press badge in plain view.

## Gustine

### Protesters attacked; police shake hands of attackers; tell protesters to wait in patrol cars | 2020-06-28

About twenty anti-BLM protesters (holding a thin blue line flag and affiliated with California Valley Patriots (CVP)) were holding a rally in Gustine California (at the corner of Grove Avenue and 5th Street). A group of around 3 young people decided to hold an impromptu counter-protest, and parked across the street from the CVP protesters. CVP protesters came across the street and began shouting at the counter-protesters. Some time later, video shows one counter-protester on the ground, on the CVP proesters' side of the street, being beaten by CVP protesters. Another counter-protester is trying to intervene but being physically restrained by CVP protesters; a third is filming the incident as CVP protesters heckle her. Photos taken after the incident show at least two of the protesters badly beaten. Each side says the other started the altercation.

Police arrived shortly thereafter. They told the counter-protesters to wait in police cars (allegedly for their own protection); the counter-protesters say they were kept in police cars for nearly an hour. The CVP protesters were not put into police cars. One counter-protester says that counter-protesters tried to leave multiple times, but were told that they were not free to go. Police can be seen shaking the hand of one of the CVP protesters; counter-protesters claim police were somewhat dismissive of their allegations of assault against the CVP protesters. No arrests were made, but a report concerning the incident has been referred to the DA.

Alleged looters and the owner and employees at a liquor store stood off outside store. A crowd had assembled to help the employees. Seeing a police cruiser passing by, one black employee flagged down the officers to request help.

The employee was arrested, along with her husband and others helping them, while the alleged looters ran off. The employee says she told police they had the wrong people and the criminals were getting away. She says the officer arresting her said, "I don't care about them." In addition, she says she was thrown against a wall when arrested.

### Police arrest protesters en masse and detain them in poor conditions | 2020-06-01

Police arrested protesters en masse in downtown Los Angeles. Protesters hands were zip tied excessively tightly behind their backs and they were loaded onto buses and driven around the city. Some were taken to a temporary field jail at UCLA's Jackie Robinson stadium; UCLA claims it "failed to stop" LAPD from using the stadium as a "staging area," but was not told about the field jail until after the fact. Arestees were detained for long periods, still in excessively tight zip ties. Social distancing procedures were not observed.

Many protesters allege that conditions in the makeshift jails were poor -- detainees denied medical attention and permission to use the restroom, for instance -- and that they were released, many with dead phones, in unfamiliar places in the middle of the night with no way to get home. Two arrestees allege that police prevented them from leaving before the curfew went into effect, then arrested them for violating the curfew. One arrestee alleges that she was twice threatened with guns, that she was sexually assaulted by police, and that police mocked detainees having panic attacks. Police also allegedly arrested at least one homeless person (to whom the curfew was not supposed to apply) for a curfew violation.

A lawsuit has been filed in connection with these and other abuses by the National Lawyers' Guild; a separate lawsuit has been filed by one of the arrestees. (See also incidents ca-losangeles-32 (near-identical behavior the following day) and ca-santamonica-2 (similar behavior in Santa Monica).)

### Police arrest protesters en masse and detain them in poor conditions | 2020-06-02

Police arrested protesters en masse near the home of LA mayor Eric Garcetti and in other parts of the city, zip tied their hands, and held them for extended periods without appropriate social distancing. At least one arrestee alleges that protesters were given explicit permission to remain past the curfew, then arrested for being out after curfew. Many arrestees say they were released in the middle of the night, without transportation home, in unfamiliar parts of the city.

Several arrestees describe police sexually harassing/assaulting them; other arrestees corroborate these accounts. Two arrestees report that processing of arrestees on their bus was delayed because they requested medical attention and other improvements in their conditions, which would constitute first-amendment-protected speech. Four other arrestees report that processing of arrestees on their bus was delayed because some arrestees removed unsafely-tight zip ties using a lighter. All arrestees who have shared accounts mention officers behaving in a mocking, condescending, and unprofessional manner. One arrestee recalls asking officers to turn on bodycams, and officers refusing to do so. If true, this would be a clear violation of LAPD policy. One arrestee allegedly should have been exempt from the curfew as they were returning home from work.

A lawsuit has been filed in connection with these and other abuses by the National Lawyers' Guild. (See also incidents ca-losangeles-19 (near-identical behavior the previous day) and ca-santamonica-2 (similar behavior in Santa Monica).)

### Protester shows wound inflicted by less-lethal round | 2020-06-03

Footage from June 3rd shows a still of a wound on a protester's abdomen, inflicted by a less-lethal round. This is in the wake of a Mayoral ordinance for the LAPD to restrict their use of kinetic projectiles, particularly rubber bullets, and the injury is more consistent with direct, close range fire than proper use. Footage was taken in Downtown LA. While it is not clear exactly where the shot was fired, the protester states at one point that he was near the harbor freeway entrance in downtown LA.

Footage from June 8th shows a medic treating a wound on the thigh of a female protester. The bullet broke the skin and has caused major bruising in a circle around the point of contact. This is in the wake of a Mayoral ordinance for the LAPD to restrict their use of kinetic projectiles, particularly rubber bullets, and the injury is more consistent with direct, close range fire than proper use.

While the location of the shooting is not certain, protesters can be heard saying they are on Melrose street. Protests tended to occur around the intersection of Melrose and Fairfax, radiating around the area.

### Police make violent arrests, including ripping a protester out of his wheelchair and inducing an asthma attack | 2020-07-15

Footage shows a scuffle as police arrest protesters. A protester in a wheelchair pushes police away from him. Police then knock him backwards out of his chair. The man attempts to pull himself away. Police close in. The protester grabs the officer's baton, but multiple officers restrain him and take his wheelchair away. One officer drags the chair and appears to knock a wheel loose, which then falls off after the officer scuffles with another protester. The protester who was in the wheelchair passively resists by locking his arms while police arrest him. Body cam footage released by the LAPD shows the man in the wheelchair striking an officer in the face during a physical altercation between the protester and the officer. Notably, the LAPD footage fails to show the lead up to the protester in the wheelchair slapping the officer.

Footage from instagram (second link, fourth in list) shows a man suffering an asthma attack after allegedly being struck in the neck with a baton. The last video in the instagram post appears to show the man on a gurney receiving medical attention. Other videos in the post show police shoving protesters with their hands and with batons. The poster also alleges that police held a woman in a chokehold.

Additional [footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCqPuekHCyg/) shows an officer striking a protester with a baton as the protester tries to help the man in the wheelchair.

Another [update](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCxPb28hRdN/) states all charges against him were dropped.

Footage shows police approaching a protester in the street and shoving her to the ground, knocking the phone out of her hand. As police continue to shove the protester, another runs into frame and knocks an officer to the ground. More police then join to arrest the two protesters. Two other protesters come into frame, yelling at police. One is thrown to the ground and knelt on by an officer to arrest her. The other is shoved over a vertical ring used to lock bikes. She is then repeatedly shoved as she tries to stand and approach her fellow protester on the ground.

### Officers shove and shoot Black Lives Matter protesters | 2020-08-21

At a dual protest between pro-Trump and Black Lives Matter protesters, BLM protesters entered the street and were confronted by police. This occurred after a member of the pro-Trump protest pepper sprayed BLM protesters.

Officers shoved protesters with batons, then an officer with a riot gun fired into the crowd from short distance. Justification is unclear. Regardless, the distance from which the officer fired the gun is against protocols.

### Police shoot at woman in apartment | 2020-05-30

A woman was yelling at police during a May 30th protest from her apartment window. Shortly after starting a recording on her cell phone, police fired projectiles at the woman's apartment. She recovered 13 projectiles, including rubber bullets and pepper balls. Several of her windows were damaged.

### Police arrest protesters en masse, confine them for long periods, and improperly zip tie them | 2020-05-31

On May 31st, police arrested numerous protesters for curfew violations. These protesters were zip tied and held for long periods, in tight quarters which did not permit social distancing, then released late at night with no way to get home. At least one detainee alleges that detainees were denied medical care and permission to use the restroom.

Zip ties were put on too tight. Police attempted to remove zip ties with a long knife (which is not the appropriate tool). This led to multiple protesters being injured, including one who required 21 stitches; it seems unlikely that the knife was appropriately sterilized between uses, raising the possibility of bloodborne pathogen transmission.

One protester, who has lived in Santa Monica since high school, states police dropped him and other protesters off outside town late at night. Police then told him he would be arrested if he returned to Santa Monica.

(See also incidents ca-losangeles-19 and ca-losangeles-32 (similar behavior in Los Angeles). Note that the final link incorrectly states that the incident it describes was perpetrated by LAPD; in fact, as several commenters pointed out, it was perpetrated by Santa Monica PD, though there are allegations of similar conduct by the LAPD.)

## Vallejo

### Police fatally shoot unarmed 22 year old | 2020-06-01

Police in northern California fatally shot an unarmed 22-year-old who was on his knees with his hands up outside a Walgreens store while responding to a call of alleged looting, officials said... An officer in the city of Vallejo was inside his car when he shot Sean Monterrosa on Monday night amid local and national protests against police brutality. Police said an officer mistakenly believed Monterrosa had a gun, but later determined he had a hammer in his pocket... 'When confronted by the police, he dropped to his knees and surrendered, and they fired at him,' said Melissa Nold, a Vallejo civil rights attorney representing Monterrosa’s family.

Six officers fired 55 bullets in 3.5 seconds; police investigation determined this use of force 'reasonable.'

Vallejo PD has posted composite video containing body cam footage, radio chatter with Dispatch and prior footage of Walgreen's security cameras being destroyed. This footage shows a car with alleged looters peeling out of the Walgreens as police arrive; this car strikes an unmarked police vehicle and continues. Police open the doors of their unmarked van and fire on Monterrosa immediately and without warning. They state that they believed Monterrosa was armed, thought it turned out to be only a hammer.

### Armored law enforcement vehicle threatens protesters, deploys tear gas on highway | 2020-06-01

In this video, an armored law enforcement vehicle tells protesters blocking a highway to disperse over megaphone. It sounds like the operator is saying "if you do not move, you will be dead," but video later released by the police department seems to show that the operator instead said "if you do not move, you will be gassed." The protesters do not move; the officers deploy tear gas, coating the highway in dense, opaque clouds of blinding fog. Vehicles are seen waiting to continue on their way; it is unclear whether these vehicles attempted to navigate the clouds of tear gas. (Note: Jalopnik reports that this happened on June 2; however, protests consistent with the video were only reported on June 1, and other sources place the video on June 1.)

### Police arrest man using excessive force, dogs | 2020-06-01

Police threw tear gas at protesters blocking a roadway in an effort to disperse them. One protester, Joseph Malott, allegedly threw a tear gas canister back at police. Police arrested him for (per Mercury News) “assaulting a police officer with a deadly weapon.” During the arrest, Malott was bitten and scratched repeatedly by a police dog, leaving bite marks and scratches all over his back and a wound on his leg which required 10 stitches. During the arrest, he says he was slammed against a fence then thrown to the ground, and recalls thinking “when are they going to take the dogs off me?”

### Bystander claims police shoot him in the eye | 2020-05-30

A man was blinded in one eye in a manner consistent with a rubber bullet. He claims a law enforcement officer riding on the back of a Denver Police Department truck fired a projectile at him without warning, despite the fact that he wasn't provoking the officer (or even protesting) at the time, and didn't see anyone near him doing so.

### Journalist injured by tear gas, less-than-lethal round | 2020-05-31

Journalist Alex Burness was hit by some sort of projectile. Later in the night, an officer ordered Burness to turn around and walk in the opposite direction (toward a large cloud of tear gas). He shouted "press," but the officer raised his weapon, forcing Burness (and an associate in a neon "press" vest) to walk into the tear gas. Journalist Dave Sachs claims something similar happened to him -- he showed his press pass to police but they shoved him into tear gas.

Burness states that he was gassed on Clarkson st near the Good Times restaurant (808 E Colfax).

### Protester struck in head at short range with explosive projectile | (Believed to be) 2020-06-05

Footage shows protesters walking away from police. An officer fires an explosive projectile at the ground, which then ricochets and strikes protester in head. Protester crumples to the ground. Title on Reddit states that the protester suffered permanent hearing loss, but this has not been verified.

It should be noted that these rounds are intended to be shot at the ground as the officer did. However, the proximity of the shot to protesters severely increased the risk of injury, as seen here.

Footage was first posted on reddit.com/r/protest on June 5th.

### Police use excessive force to clear protester tent encampment | 2020-07-01

The first clip is a livestream from the night of the dispersal at Civic Center Park. Police standoff begins around 1:28:00. Police begin by snatching and grabbing protesters to arrest. Then a scuffle breaks out, the camera pans to show an officer striking protesters with his baton. Another officer approaches and pepper-sprays protesters. A third officer fires a riot gun, containing either pepper balls or paintballs, at protesters. Police then tear gas the area while protesters flee. At 1:34:00, police arrest a medic. At 1:38:00, police advance towards the protesters again, pushing them off the sidewalk to the far side of the street. A shot can be heard, then a scream. The camera pans to show a scuffle between police and protesters. Police then use pepper-spray and riot rounds to force protesters back. A protester is arrested. The arrest takes several minutes and it appears that police kneel on the woman's neck while making the arrest. At 1:51:00, one officer is shown without a badge number or body cam. The filmer then looks at several other officers.

The third link shows another angle on the incident at 1:28:00.

The fourth link shows another angle on the incident at 1:38:00. In addition, the caption states that police were using pepper balls.

### Police pepper spray BLM counter-protesters at pro-police rally | 2020-07-19

Article discusses use of pepper spray at pro-police rally where Black Lives Matter groups counter-protested. “We had two pepper ball deployments and one hand-held fog device deployment, and we made one arrest for assault,” Denver police spokesman Tyrone Campbell said. The hand-held fog device is believed to refer to pepper spray. The spokesman goes on to say that "It seems as if [riot control devices] were used in an appropriate fashion." Some additional footage shows police pepper-spraying a retreating crowd. Riot guns can also be heard firing.

### Denver police tackle, arrest, and sexually assault protester | 2020-07-29

At a protest on July 29th, a protester was tackled by police. Police claim the man resisted arrest and attempted to disarm an officer. The protester denies these allegations, saying he was rattling a chain link fence and no more.

After tackling the protester, officers punched him and struck him with a baton. One officer can be seen jabbing the protester in the rear end with a baton. The protester states he was sexually assault, with the officer shoving the baton into his rectum. That night, he was given a rape kit and examined for signs of sexual assault. Records from a specialist two weeks later diagnosed the protester with rectal and anal hemorrhage, as well as hemorrhoids.

The protester will go to court on September 28th to fight the charge of disarming a police officer.

### Police tackle and detain 6 protesters | 2020-05-31

Waterbury police detain at least 6 people at an assembly at the intersection of Wolcott St. and Long Hill Rd., apparently for blocking the road. Police had warned protesters several times that if they remained on Wolcott St., they would be arrested. Police tackle multiple protesters, including one (who one post claims is 15 years old) who is thrown to the ground and pinned down for an extended period, with one officer kneeling on him, in what appears to be excessive force. A dog is present, but apparently not used. Waterbury authorities say no property was damaged during the protest. Arrested protesters were not charged.

### Police detain protesters | 2020-05-31

A group of people are protesting outside Waterbury police headquarters around 5:30PM. Police are lined up blocking the roadway; they warn protesters to clear the roadway. Police declare the assembly unlawful, apparently in response to the protesters standing in the roadway. Police again warn protesters to clear the roadway, and say that anyone in the roadway will be arrested. A woman steps out into the street, walking slowly across holding a sign. Police tell her to get out of the roadway; she continues across to the other side. Police move forward and arrest numerous protesters, several of whom do not appear to have been in the roadway to begin with. Several protesters are forced to the ground, including one who is slammed against a police car (see second link). Later in the same incident (around 6:30 in the first link), police aggressively and without apparent reason arrest another protester. An LRAD is mentioned, but apparently not deployed. Waterbury authorities say no property was damaged during the protest. Arrested protesters were not charged. (Note: this is a different incident from ct-waterbury-2 -- see street view.)

### Police shove a woman down to her knees | 2020-05-31

It is seen in the video that while the people were protesting, a few cops tried dispersing them, and shoved a woman to her knees, and later hit her on the head.

Miami Herald later reports the officer has a history of drawing his weapon and using force. He has been suspended.

A more recent update states that the officer has been charged with battery.

### Police laugh and joke when they think their body cams are off | 2020-05-31

Body cam video released by Fort Lauderdale PD on Youtube shows police laughing and joking after shooting protesters with rubber bullets and tear gas. They are speaking candidly to one another because they mistakenly believe their cams are in "standby" mode and not recording. Policing experts who reviewed the footage say that the behavior is unprofessional and that the officers felt "comfortable about talking about turning the camera off." At 2:55, a cop can be heard saying "if you need it, give me a target." The Miami Herald quotes a retired Lieutenant Colonel as commenting, "If you're not seeing a threat, why are you asking for a threat? That would almost lead you to believe that they were indiscriminately firing."

### Police deployed two rounds of tear gas against peaceful protesters | 2020-06-27

A group of protesters blocked highway 395 in Miami. Police deployed tear gas at 9:00 pm and 9:09 PM to clear protesters.

In the 9:00 PM round, the filmer can be heard saying, "They're smoke bombs. No, they're not. They're tear gas." The filmer then flees with other protesters. Footage then shows a woman screaming and in sufficient pain that another protester is needed to carry her away quickly.

Around 9:09 PM, protesters gathered on the highway on-ramp. Police then, without warning, fired another round of tear gas, forcing protesters to flee. The caption states multiple protesters were shot with rubber bullets, but no shots can be heard in this footage.

### Police officer grabs arrestee's breast; police violently arrest protester | 2020-07-01

Footage shows police arresting a woman. A man who walked nearby with his hands up is thrown to the ground by two officers and arrested.

Additional footage shows an officer grabbing the breast of the woman arrested. It should be noted that police use an "open hand" frisking technique to check along the breasts during an arrest. However the officer does not appear to be using an open hand and appears to be grabbing the woman, rather than frisking her. While having a male officer frisk a female protester without warning is a point of controversy, this incident appears to be outside police guidelines even discounting that fact.

### Journalist detained by police near downtown connector | 2020-06-01

A photojournalist with the Atlanta Journal Constitution was detained by police at a protest. Another journalist spotted her zip-tied with her hands behind her back and sitting under an overpass.

Another officer notes the journalist's press pass and asks who detained her. The journalist said the arresting officer left before giving a name. She was soon released, having been detained for about 10 minutes.

The incident begins around 13:30 in the Facebook video.

### Sheriff scuffles with protester over "F\*ck Trump" sign | 2020-06-03

Lowndes County sheriff, Ashley Paulk, confiscated a "F\*ck Trump" sign from a protester, citing it as "evidence" for a crime not stated, in itself a violation of 1st Amendment rights. The woman attempted to grab the sign back and the sheriff choked her in response, before protesters separated the two.

In a later statement, the sheriff said he would continue to charge protesters carrying posters with profanity with misdemeanor disorderly conduct, in violation of Supreme Court case [Cohen v. California](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7398433541275578772&q=cohen+v.+california&hl=en&as_sdt=3,39) which ruled a man wearing a "Fuck the Draft" jacket could not be convicted for disturbing the peace. In addition, a [Georgia supreme court case](https://law.justia.com/cases/georgia/supreme-court/2017/s17a1040.html) cleared a man charged with disorderly conduct for raising his middle finger in a church. The sheriff cited a Georgia law allowing misdemeanor charges for profanity in the presence of an individual under 14 years of age.

In the background of the second clip, a police cruiser marked "Valdosta" can be seen, establishing the location.

He cited a Georgia law allowing misdemeanor charges for profanity in the presence of an individual under 14 years of age, despite [U.S. Supreme Court cases](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7398433541275578772&q=cohen+v.+california&hl=en&as_sdt=3,39) and [Georgia Supreme Court cases](https://law.justia.com/cases/georgia/supreme-court/2017/s17a1040.html) exonerating individuals charged with similar crimes.

### Police pull black women out of the car and throw them to the ground | 2020-05-31

Police are seen attacking a car and pulling two black women out of a car and shoving them to the ground (unclear motive). Block Club Chicago states the victims were detained for disorderly conduct and that police drove off with one of the victims in the car, leaving the other two in the lot.

Victim states that officers kneeled on her neck, that shards of glass from her broken window lacerated her face, and that an officer called her "a f---- savage." In addition, she states she was not given access to an attorney and was not allowed a phone call for 6 hours.

After release (with neither charges nor explanation), the victim attempted to file a complaint but was told the complaint line was unnaccesible.

This was reported to have happened at "2600 N. Narragansett Ave.", but 2700 N seems slightly more accurate. Google Streetview at that address shows the same "Show Carnival" store seen in the video.

### Police surround protesters and search their bags | 2020-08-15

At a protest on August 15th, police kettled protesters at West Marble Place and South LaSalle Street. Police refused to allow protesters to leave without a bag search. Officers took protesters' bags and dumped them onto the sidewalk.

The 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gives individuals the right to privacy and freedom from unreasonable searches. Most warrantless searches are considered unreasonable, with the exception of searches with consent of the searched or with probable cause. By disallowing protesters to leave, police did not allow protesters to consent. Further, probable cause has been determined on several occassions to be individualized, meaning that individuals on the premises of a crime scene cannot be searched simply for being present; rather, probable cause must be established for each individual, as in [Ybarra v. Illinois](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1979/78-5937) and [United States v. Di Re](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/332/581/). This means that, in order to search protester's belongings, police would have needed to establish probable cause for each protester searched.

The Terry standard does allow police to briefly detain and search an individual on reasonable suspicion, which has a lower bar than probable cause. In [Terry v. Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/392/1/), the U.S. Supreme Court stated that police may stop and frisk - which is limited to an external pat down (e.g. for an readily-usable weapon), but does not include bag searches - an individual on the basis of reasonable suspicion. Reasonable suspicion is defined in the case as the reasonable suspicion that an individual may have committed, be committing, or is about to commit a crime. There must additionally be the reasonable belief that the individual is armed and dangerous. In addition, this reasonable suspicion is individualized, so police must have established reasonable suspicion that each protester searched was both armed and engaged in, had engaged in, or was going to engage in criminal conduct.

After reviewing the rights of protesters, it appears that police conducted these searches illegally, abusing their power to prevent protesters from leaving.

### Police break up a small protest and shoots at them as they leave | 2020-06-14

There is a very small protest of what appears to be no more than 15 people. Police arrive declaring it an unlawful assembly. Some of the protesters, including the person filming, go into a nearby restaurant because their car was in the direction of the police and they did not feel comfortable walking towards them. Two militarized police come into the restaurant and make them exit. The police tell them to run, motioning with their hands in the direction away from the protester's car, despite the protester trying to explain that they need to go in the other direction to actually leave. They run as they are told, and say they have their hands up. It then appears the police fire rubber bullets at them, the camera was facing away from the police but it picks up the sounds. The video is in two parts and includes further context via subtitles.

A woman is seen being restrained by a police officer who stands behind her with his arms around her torso. She struggles with the officer and breaks free, after which she is repeatedly beaten on the thighs with batons and shot with what appear to be pepper balls by officers shouting "Get on the ground!" while she is standing still. Another woman walks towards the officers with her hands out, seeming to plead for restraint but not directly interfering. An officer yells at her to "Back up!" and then violently shoves her to the ground.

Two IMPD officers have since been indicted for battery and other use of force charges.

### Police push, shove and pepper-spray protesters | 2020-06-22

First person footage of a protest shows police forcing protesters down a sidewalk. It is unclear why police determined protesters could not continue to protest peacefully at the point of the sidewalk.

Police use their shields to shove protesters along. Footage is dark and a little unclear, but it appears that around 2 minutes, the filmer and her sisters are pepper-sprayed. They scream in pain and the filmer states repeatedly that she cannot see. The filmer then loses track of her sisters. She finds one family member around 4 minutes, who shows clear signs of having been pepper sprayed.

The filmer and her sister attempted to regroup and find their third family member, but police continued to shove them along.

Around 4:15 a protester is shoved to the ground. She can be heard screaming, "My leg, my leg."

After this, footage cuts to a shot of the filmer turns the camera on herself and her eyes are watering, showing clear indication of pepper spray. It is unclear if this is from the first round of pepper spray or she has been sprayed a second time. Medics attempt to assist her but are forced to continue marching while doing so. Around 7 minutes, medics help her into a car. She is treated for the duration of the footage.

Additional links from a reporter discuss the tactics used by police to intimidate and harass protesters. They also capture the aftermath of the pepper-spraying.

White protesters were inside the Capitol, police identified some of them claimed to have vandalized police car in the past, and arrests were made inside the Capitol for those individuals. However, the arrested individuals declined the allegations. The protesters followed the police outside the Capitol, and one of the protesters blocked their path and later the crowd tried to pull the arrestees from the custody of the police officers. That is when more crowds and police started to get involved. Police used pepper spray to help disperse the crowd and arrested 17 people, including two juveniles.

### Iowa State Police use tear gas & flashbangs against crowd of civilians attempting to enter I-80 and later against Iowa City EMS. | 2020-06-03

State police shoot tear gas into, and deploy flashbangs against, a crowd of peaceful protesters attempting to enter I-80. Some protesters stumble and fall as they try to flee.

Reportedly,  one protester suffered seizures as a result of a flashbang, and an ambulance was called to the scene.

Police continued to deploy tear gas and flashbangs in the area where Iowa city EMT's were working (see flashing white lights in cloud of gas, 5th link). Unclear if they were aware of EMS presence.

According to the mayor, Iowa State Patrol was in command of the scene (though some Iowa City Police were present) and it was determined that letting the protest onto I-80 was too dangerous.

### Restaurant owner shot and killed | 2020-06-01

LMPD and KY National Guard were sent to 26th and Broadway to disperse a gathering (unrelated to protests) in violation of curfew. Police officer Katie Crews crosses the street and begins firing pepper balls at a group standing outside. A pepper ball hit the doorway of YaYa's BBQ (the victim's business), nearly striking his niece. He went outside and appears to fire a single shot into the air. He steps inside and then steps back out and is shot and killed by police and guardsman. Officers were required to wear bodycams and have them activated as a reform after the police killing of Breonna Taylor, but of the 20 officers on scene, LMPD claims 0 were using their bodycams.

### Pastor violently arrested during protest | 2020-06-01

During a protest on June 1st, a pastor was arrested. He states officers yelled at him and told him to move. When he did not, he states that an officer ordered others to arrest him; those officers then threw him to the ground to handcuff him.

Footage from news sources show 2 officers kneeling on his legs and back. It also shows an officer pressing what appears to be a service sidearm to the pastor's head. One news sourcee and the pastor's official complaint state this occurred on Shelbyville Road in front of the Oxmoor Center mall.

After Findley was placed in a squad car, he told police he was a pastor. He was then released without charges.

The pastor is now suing the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department.

After an incident in which local photographer and protester Tyler Gerth was shot by Steven Lopez, LMPD removed all protesters from Jefferson Square Park.

After public outrage, the mayor offered reimbursement, but only to those who could prove ownership and show receipts of purchase.

### LMPD Bearcat strikes vehicle; police initially state vehicle hit them, then retract the statement; in addition, bystander filming is arrested | 2020-07-01

On July 1st, a collision was reported between a bystander vehicle and an LMPD armored car, also called a Bearcat. Police initially stated that the Bearcat was rammed by a protester vehicle. They later retracted this statement, saying that in fact the Bearcat hit the vehicle. It is not clear if the vehicle was related to the protest at all. However, police state that they intentionally hit the vehicle to prevent further harm, stating that they recognized the vehicle from an incident the previous night.

A woman filming the incident from her car stepped out and asked someone for their name. She was then arrested.

Additional footage from a bystander shows the filmer running out of the way of the Bearcat to avoid being hit.

A WDRB article states the incident occurred near a Chase bank by Jefferson Square Park.

### Police target independent journalists and livestreamers for second consecutive night | 2020-07-01

Footage from two livestreamers on July 1st shows their arrests. LMPD arrested livestreamers the previous night as well. It should be noted that these independent journalists are not always credentialed, but they are known for releasing full, unedited footage of the protests.

The ACLU has raised concerns that these arrests are inhibiting freedom of the press, while Louisville Metropolitan Police Department has stated that the department "has no issue with anyone livestreaming. But many of those livestreaming are also protesting. And anyone protesting who fails to follow police orders to disperse may be arrested."

The journalist from MilkyMess TV took 1st person footage of their arrest. Around 1:50:00 in her Facebook live post, she is wandering around a crowd of protesters on the sidewalk. The journalist does not appear to be chanting or singing with protesters. Several police cruisers pull up and officers step out. The journalist steps forward to get a better look and is arrested without a word. The camera is knocked from her hand.

An additional livestream from a reporter affiliated with WDRB News shows the incident. Beginning at 3:05:00, police arrive, appear to single out MilkyMess and tackle her to the ground. The reporter asks why she is being arrested. A police officer says, "Trespassing." It should be noted that MilkyMess was on a public sidewalk and numerous other individuals were not arrested. Around 3:11:00, the WDRB reporter walks over to another arrestee. Shortly after, the reporter asks an officer if he should be in the street or sidewalk. The officer tells him he's "gotta go." The reporter crosses to the other side of the street and asks another person if there were arrests. The individual says there was one arrest. This totals 3 arrests for trespassing on a park/public sidewalk out of a group of 30-40 individuals.

### Police respond to splashed water with excessive force | 2020-07-07

Police are attempting to tow a car at 6th and Jefferson; protesters have gathered in opposition. A protester splashes water on an officer and attempts to run away. The officer chases her, holds her in a headlock, and forces her to the ground with the aid of several other officers. One officer kneels on the protester to arrest her while other officers hold the crowd back. One officer can be heard saying repeatedly saying, "Back the fuck off."

The filmer also posted a screenshot, alleging that the protester was charged with disorderly conduct, possession of marijuana, inciting a riot, and third degree assault of an officer. Third degree assault is generally classified as the intent to cause serious bodily harm, generally with a deadly weapon. The filmer is a journalist with the Courier Journal and is verified on Twitter, lending some credence to her allegations about the charges.

### Police fire impact munitions, make violent arrests | 2020-09-23

Police surround protesters, forming lines across the street that kettle the protesters in place. Police fire pepper balls at protesters and some protesters respond with water bottles, but the vast majority stand around. Arrests were also made at the time. One arrestee appeared to be a bystander attempting to turn their moped around; the individual was knocked to the ground, then pulled off the moped by police.

A Fox News report estimates about a dozen arrests during this incident. The reporter states that he believes zip ties and handcuffs were used to detain protesters.

The incident may have been initiated when a protester with a shield stopped moving and an officer shoved him. The protester shoved back and a second protester threw a vial of liquid on an officer. Then a noise can be heard and protesters begin to scatter.

Police line is seen using shields to push back a small group of protesters. The filmer, a reporter, moves around to the other side of the protesters. At this point, the footage captures another group of police officers charging the protesters from behind without warning.

The footage becomes blurry as it appears that police strike the reporter, who repeatedly states, "I am press," and is standing alongside several camera crews.

The reporter states that they were beaten by police, their glasses were broken, and their phone thrown. In a subsequent video, the reporter speaks to the police chief and states in the description that they were pepper-sprayed. The police chief states that he will open an investigation. A second reporter off-screen tells the chief that multiple journalists were assaulted. One journalist was briefly arrested and zip-tied before being released.

### Police use LRAD (sound cannon) to disperse protesters | 2020-06-02

Video shows sound cannon deployed alongside APC. The LRAD can be heard with its characteristic alarm.

The use of LRADs is a subject of much contention, with frequent reports of permanent nerve and hearing damage caused by their use.

The ACLU's [position](https://www.aclu.org/fact-sheet/acoustic-weapons-fact-sheet) is that due to the high risk of damage and lack of research on lasting effects, LRADs should not be deployed to disperse protests.

### Police shove elderly man, causing him to fall and hit the back of his head | 2020-06-04

Two police officers shove an unarmed, elderly man ([reportedly 75 years old](https://twitter.com/HannahBuehler/status/1268742666210226177)), who falls backwards and strikes his head on the concrete sidewalk. He appears to begin bleeding from his ear and passes out.

Buffalo P.D. released an official statement saying that he "tripped and fell." After video of the incident surfaced, however, both officers were suspended, an internal affairs investigation was opened, and both officers were charged with assault. In response to the suspension, the Buffalo Emergency Response Team [resigned from their posts](https://nypost.com/2020/06/05/buffalo-emergency-response-team-quits-in-solidarity-of-cops/). At first, the two officers were suspended without pay, but because the Buffalo police contract only allows suspension without pay for 30 days, they are now (as of July 10) suspended with pay.

The man suffered brain damage and has begun physical therapy.

An NYPD SUV's path is blocked by a crowd of protesters at Flatbush and St. Marks. Protesters begin throwing things at the SUV. Another NYPD SUV drives up alongside the first, then drives through the crowd, forcing protesters out of its way. The first car then drives forward, ramming the dense crowd of civilians in front of it. NYPD's internal affairs bureau conducted a review and found no wrongdoing. The police commissioner said that "preliminarily we have an accounting of that incident where we have officers in a situation where they're essentially being penned in by protesters," but it seems from the video as though, throughout the incident, both cars have a clear route of escape behind them.

### Alleged looter pulled from car and beaten | 2020-06-01

Footage shows a cluster of NYPD officers striking a vehicle with batons and kicking it, before pulling the driver onto the street and arresting them. Footage shows police smashed several of the car's windows.

Officers allege the driver and passenger were looters and had tried to run over police.

Officers additionally allege that the passenger attempted to jump to the driver's seat, run over an NYPD officer, and drive away. However, footage shows heavy traffic on all sides of the car and does not capture the alleged attempt by the passenger.

The driver was charged with attempted murder, assault with intent to cause injury, criminal possession of stolen property, and obstructing government administration. The DA's office later downgraded the attempted murder charge to second-degree assault.

### Protesters detained more than 24 hours by police; upheld by NY Judge | 2020-06-04

The Legal Aid Society, a law firm for low-income families and individuals, filed an emergency lawsuit after learning protesters had been detained for over 24 hours without arraignment, in violation of New York state law.

A New York state judge rejected the appeal, allowing the NYPD to continue holding protesters, citing the virtual arraignments made necessary by the COVID-19 pandemic as a cause of slower processing. However, the Legal Aid Society states that conditions are not suitable for social distancing in the holding cells, thus risking an increased spread of COVID-19.

### Reporter for The Blade arrested at protest | 2020-08-09

A journalist working for The Asheville Blade was following protests in their car on August 9th. They state that police stopped them without warning, pulled them out of their car, zip-tied and arrested them. They state that because of the heat, their sweat made their hands slippery and their zip-ties fell off; an officer then replaced them with standard handcuffs, cuffing the journalist's arms tightly behind their back.

They state that after being removed from the police wagon, they were patted down. A female cop stood by while a male cop patted them down. The journalist states the male cop's "hands aggressively slid over my vagina and my ass."

They were held in a cell for several hours, in and out of cuffs. Several police officers asked the journalist if they were going to behave now, and made other similar comments.

Images taken after release show significant bruising on one of the journalist's arms.

### Police target, follow and arrest protester | 2020-06-04

On June 4th, Conrad James, a prominent protester in Raleigh, threatened to file a class action lawsuit against the Raleigh police departments.

In the early hours of the morning on June 5th, men in black, without visible badge numbers, raided James' home and arrested him for allegedly failing to return a rental car. James denies these claims. The arrest took place in a county under the jurisdiction of the Wake County Sheriff's Office and the Fuquay-Varina Police Department. The sheriff's office, the Fuquay-Varina Police, and the Raleigh Police give differing accounts about the departments involved and the time at which the raid took place.

Police scanner audio shows that Raleigh police officers were following him during protests later that day.

### Peaceful protester on sidewalk pepper sprayed | 2020-05-30

Footage from a news report outside the Cincinnati police headquarters shows a protester standing on the sidewalk with his hands on his head. An officer passing by unholsters his pepper spray and discharges it into the man's eyes, seemingly unprovoked.

The reporter states that rubber bullets and flashbangs are also being used on the crowd.

### Police violently disperse crowds, before curfew and allegedly without provocation | 2020-05-31

Police use tear gas to disperse a crowd near the Hamilton County Courthouse before curfew. No provocation is mentioned in the news article; a first-hand account posted to facebook claims there was none. The account posted to Facebook claims that no order to disperse was given; local news coverage does not mention any order to disperse being given. Mass arrests were conducted at some point the night of the 31st. The account posted to Facebook claims that police surrounded and trapped protesters before curfew, and beat some protesters.

### Tattoo artist arrested while painting the outside of his shop; police fail to deescalate | 2020-05-31

Jamison Walker, a Cincinnati tattoo artist at Black Fern Tattoo, was painting the outside of the shop after curfew (with the owner's permission). He alleges that a police officer told him he could finish his work. The Instagram video begins at some later point as several cops approach. They tell Walker (and at least two other persons present) to "get inside." For around 12 seconds, two police officers, Walker, and one other tattoo shop employee are talking simultaneously; Walker told local news he tried to go inside but one officer blocked his path. One officer can be heard to say "I'm giving you a chance, go in," then another can be heard to say "That's exactly what's going to happen -- no -- no no -- inside, go inside, inside -- go inside, there's no debate -- no, you may not." Said officer then begins arresting Walker. Officers shove Walker against a wall and grab his arms; they yell for him to put his hands behind his back. One officer draws a taser and holds it near Walker's shoulder. Meanwhile, one of Walker's colleagues is filming; police scream at her to "get the fuck back -- get back." It's unclear whether she's standing in a doorway or backed up against a wall. Another officer is acting very aggressively and has his taser drawn until the cop next to him taps him on the arm, at which point he holsters his taser and steps back. In total, at least eight police officers are present, of whom at least two draw their tasers, despite facing little to no resistance.

NOTE: While curfews in many cities exempted anyone going to or from work, Cincinnati's exempted only essential workers. Tattoo artists are not essential, so Walker's arrest was likely lawful, though officers unnecessarily escalated the situation as they were arresting him.

### Protester pepper sprayed without cause | 2020-05-30

Footage from a body cam captures an officer approaching a woman standing still with a sign at her feet. The officer then discharges pepper spray at her without warning. This led to an escalation, where less lethal shots can be heard fired. The officer was allegedly aiming for an individual carrying a handicap parking sign several feet from the protester who was pepper sprayed. A police official also suggested that the woman may have been providing cover for agitators behind her. No evidence of this can be seen.

### Federal officers retaliate to protesters with tear gas, flashbangs and impact munitions | 2020-07-21

After a small group of protesters damaged the plywood barricade on the US District Courthouse doors around 12:30 AM PST, federal agents emerged from the US District Courthouse and deployed a variety of riot control munitions against all protesters for a period lasting about half an hour. These munitions include tear gas, flashbangs and unknown less-lethal projectiles.

Prior to emerging, officers dropped a tear gas canister out of a window in the barricade, seen [here](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1285465270685859841).

One reporter [states](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1285465270685859841) he was shoved by an officer, but does not have any supporting footage.

[This footage](https://twitter.com/MrOlmos/status/1285480573981491203) from reporter Sergio Olmos shows officers grabbing protesters who are passively resisting and brandishing batons at others. This footage also shows a protester using a leafblower to redirect tear gas.

[This footage](https://twitter.com/defendpdx/status/1285481849372831749) shows officers throwing explosives at a protester attempting to collect garbage from the street.

It appears that protesters did damage part of the plywood barricade around the US District Courthouse doors, seen [here](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1285482389628583936).

An [image](https://twitter.com/ProudBulba/status/1285671820637732867) from a protester shows a wound received allegedly at this protest. The protester also displays the projectile that hit her, a pepper ball.

Additional [footage](https://twitter.com/45thabsurdist/status/1285498471521239040) shows a car with an explosive projectile fizzling underneath it. Protesters rally to put it out, preventing further damage.

### Federal officers use flashbangs, tear gas and impact munitions to push protesters a third time | 2020-07-22

In the final push of the night, federal officers once again used flashbangs, tear gas and less-lethal projectiles to push protesters down Main Street, out of Chapman and Lownsdale Squares. Protesters eventually returned to the squares, to find officers had destroyed much of the Riot Ribs medical tent, flipping tables and pepper-spraying supplies.

Footage [here](https://twitter.com/defendpdx/status/1285866491275931649) shows officers charging at the crowd, at which point a protester launched a firework. Officers then continued to deploy riot control munitions.

The officers appear to have initially exited the US District Courthouse because protesters were tearing at the building's plywood barricade.

### Federal officers use excessive force to push protesters | 2020-07-22

After protesters fire flares and roman candles across the US District Courthouse fence, small fires begin in the courtyard. In addition, protesters tear a small breach in the fence.

Federal officers deploy tear gas, flashbangs and impact munitions in massive quantities at protesters separated from them by a fence.

As officers and protesters are separated by a fence, there is little to suggest protesters pose an immediate physical threat to officers at any point.

These events occurred shortly before midnight on the night of July 22nd.

Two individuals who attended protests in Portland on July 22nd have been hospitalized for injuries sustained from less lethal rounds used by federal officers near 3rd and Madison.

One protester was shot in the head just below his helmet. A medic who attended him on site says he lost consciousness repeatedly on the way to the hospital. A CT scan revealed metal shrapnel in his head. The protester is now home and is expected to make a full recovery.

The other protester was shot repeatedly in the abdomen. One round pierced through his skin, fat and a first layer of muscle on his back. A trauma surgeon investigated and found that the round had not pierced the protester's abdominal cavity.

### Federal officers fire tear gas, flashbangs and pepper balls at crowd | 2020-07-24

Around 11:30 pm on the night of July 24th, federal officers emerged from the US District Courthouse in response to several protester actions: [protesters shaking the fence](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1286905515809705988), protesters launching fireworks and trash, and [protesters with a power saw attempting to breach the fence](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1286911312065253376).

Federal response was to engage the more peaceful side of the crowd, where [Moms Against Police Brutality were protesting](https://twitter.com/PDocumentarians/status/1286915796795396097), then to move over and engage the protesters who had been throwing objects and attempting to breach the fence. Federal officers used excessive force, especially against non-aggressive protesters.

In addition, at least one journalist is struck by a flashbang, seen [here](https://twitter.com/tuckwoodstock/status/1286909282579959810). Officers also used pepper spray or mace through the fence, seen [here](https://twitter.com/DjMontecito/status/1286911093063860225).

### Federal agents deploy tear gas and impact munitions | 2020-10-06

After declaring an unlawful assembly at a protest outside an ICE facility in Portland, federal agents emerge from the building, firing tear gas, impact munitions (believed to be pepper balls) and stun grenades. A smoke bomb was thrown by a protester onto the ICE building roof prior to officers declaring unlawful assembly, but no officers were outside at the time.

A Portland resident living in a nearby apartment called an ambulance due to complications from tear gas exposure. She has since been discharged, but said in an interview that she "thought [she] was going to die."

### Police make violent mass arrests | 2020-10-10

15 minutes into a protest near the Blazers Boys and Girls Club, police violently arrest protesters en masse, tackling some protesters and deploying mace against others. Police also ripped umbrellas away from protesters, destroying them. Police had not declared an unlawful assembly, although police had allegedly issued a single warning to protesters to stay off the streets. Several journalists were shoved by police and forced to disperse, in clear violation of the recently renewed TRO exempting members of the press from dispersal orders.

In a press release posted after the fact, police alleged that the protesters were blocking traffic and wearing all black, which would be difficult for motorists to see. As a result, Portland police said, they arrested protesters out of concern for their safety.

Police later released charges, calling the arrests "targeted;" a journalist spoke with a Portland Police spokesperson who defined targeted arrests means "those committing a crime." 26 protesters were arrested; all were charged with interfering with a police officer and with disorderly conduct. Some others were charged with resisting arrest, attempted escape, and possession of a concealed weapon.

### Police escalate conflict with tear gas | 2020-12-31

After a protracted exchange between protesters and police, police, along with DHS agents and Multinomah County Sheriff's Deputies, deployed tear gas against protesters. The tear gas is in direct violation of a PPB ban on tear gas, though likely other departments were brought in to deploy the tear gas itself.

Leading up to this exchange, protesters had thrown paint, fireworks and other small projectiles at police. Additionally, protesters had smashed the windows of several storefronts. In response, police fired smoke grenades, pepper spray, and impact munitions (believed to be pepper balls) at protesters.

An independent photographer was at one point struck in the foot with a tear gas canister, and another journalist was shoved to the ground.

### Police tear gas protesters | 2020-09-13

Following a police shooting in Lancaster, protesters gathered at West Chestnut and North Prince Streets, forming makeshift barricades in the road. Police responded with chemical agents - believed by protesters to be tear gas, though police claim it was "OC spray," the same compound as pepper spray. However, a spent canister recovered by a journalist shows police used "CS smoke," or tear gas.

12 Protesters were arrested. One was a minor who was shortly released. Seven are being held on $1,000,000 bail (current as of September 15th, 2020). The ACLU has released a statement decrying the high bail.

### Philadelphia Police Trap Protesters on Highway, Then Tear Gas Them and Shoot Rubber Bullets | 2020-06-01

An estimated 3000-5000 protesters moved onto Interstate 676, stopping traffic. Protesters move into a tunnel under 20th street. An eye-witness states that officers inside the tunnel (eastbound on I-676) began shooting rubber bullets and macing protesters without any warning or any instructions to halt the protest on the highway. Protesters clear the tunnel, many kneel and put their hands up. Police shoot tear gas at protesters to disperse the crowd, they escape to the hill between 20th and 21st street as there was tear gas westbound on the interstate and they were still being fired at by officers in the tunnel to the east. Some throw canisters back. Officers chase protesters up the hill and appear to detain a number of them. Other officers continue to fire tear gas on to the hill, despite the only visible escape from the tear gas being over a ~10 ft fence.

### Police shove protesters and strike man across the face with a baton | 2020-06-01

Police shove a group of protesters near the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. A particularly aggressive police officer in a white shirt runs and shoves someone, then grabs another man. He is then approached by a young man with long hair whom he strikes with his baton, at full strength, in the head before jumping on him and cuffing him. He has assistance from another officer who presses the man's face to the pavement using his knee on his neck. Twitter accounts misreport the individual as female; later accounts in media report the individual is a male Temple University engineering student.

He now faces charges of aggravated assault, simple assault, possession of an instrument of crime and recklessly endangering another person. His bail was set at $10,000. The officer has been suspended with intent to dismiss him. The protester was detained for 24 hours, but ultimately released without charges.

### Reporter is harassed and assaulted by pro-Columbus supporters; police tell reporter to leave the scene | 2020-06-13

A reporter from Unicorn Riot showed up at a pro-Columbus rally at a statue of Christopher Columbus in Philadelphia. He is harassed, threatened and assaulted by members of the rally. In addition, an article published by Unicorn Riot states that members of the rally slashed the journalist's tires.  After several minutes, police intervene to push protesters back, but make no arrests. They appear to say nothing more to members of the rally than, "Leave him alone."

The reporter continues to film from a distance.

Around 6:20, the journalist is assaulted again by a man who says he doesn't want the journalist to film.

Shortly after, the journalist is told by the officer that he has been warned 3 times to leave. The journalist insists he is here to film. The officer states that the journalist is inciting a riot and should be mindful of the curfew time.

### Police break car windows, pull passengers from vehicle, and beat them | 2020-10-27

Philadelphia police approach a car in the street on the 5200 block of Chestnut Street, beating it with their batons. Officers then smash out the driver side window before opening the door, beating the driver and front passenger with batons. Police also pulled a child out of the backseat of the car. Later reporting has stated that the driver and her 16 year old out of the car. They were hospitalized and handcuffed to their hospital beds while being treated. The following morning they were released without charges, though the mother's hospital bracelet read: "assault on police." The driver was able to contact her mother, the grandmother of the child pulled from the backseat. The grandmother went to the scene of the incident, then was directed four miles away, where she found the boy in a squad car. She said the boy had a lump on his head and his carseat still contained glass from the broken windows. An attorney representing the family has stated they have been told neither the current location of the family's SUV nor any process to retrieve the vehicle. The lawyer also states that the family is showing signs of trauma, including the young boy, who is hearing impaired and still learning to speak.

Several days later, the Fraternal Order of Police posted on several social media outlets that they had rescued a child wandering barefoot on the streets during the protest, following by several police slogans, like "We are the thin blue line," and reiterating a common pro-police point about standing between order and anarchy. The child in the post was in fact the child pulled by police from the car. The posts have since been deleted. The day after the posts (10/30), the Fraternal Order of Police released a statement saying there were "conflicted accounts under which the child came to be assisted by the officer."

### Police tear-gas, shoot and arrest protester confused by contradicting police instructions | 2020-05-30

John Connors, a protester in Pittsburgh on Saturday, May 30th, was recording the protest on his phone near Liberty Avenue and 7th Street. Police told him to leave the area or risk arrest. He is heard asking which direction to go. The direction given was already blocked off, so he asked for more clarity. He was given additional instructions and made his way towards a 7/11.

He asks an officer, "Are you guys police officers or are you guys cops?" The officer then release a tear gas canister at his feet and shoots him at short range. Police then arrest Connors. Connors admits his question was antagonizing, but states he did nothing to threaten officers or escalate to violence, which is supported by the footage.

A woman in East Liberty (5700 Centre Avenue) gets onto her knees and puts her hands in the air, while repeatedly yelling "we're peaceful, don't shoot!" Officers approach her and one of them sprays pepper spray onto her. The woman who recorded the video, Abigail Rubio, claims the police returned the next day and claimed they had video evidence of her throwing items off her balcony at them, a claim she denies and says was meant to intimidate her after posting the video. She filed a complaint with the local Citizen Review Board.

Users on Twitter allege the woman was a medic attempting to notify the police and/or provide aid to an injured person in a nearby parking garage.

The LRAD dispersal function can also be heard.

After this protesters begin throwing things at police. The pepper-sprayed protester swings his sign at the officer.

## Cottonwood Heights

### Police beat and pepper spray protesters during violent arrests | 2020-08-02

During a protest on August 2nd over Zane James who was killed by police a few years ago, police blocked off a residential road, down which protesters were travelling. Police then ordered protesters to the sidewalk. It is difficult to ascertain how the scuffle began; both protesters and police place the blame on the other. It appears that one officer and one protester got into a verbal altercation, after which the two go to the ground, grappling. The officer ends up holding the protester down, but it is difficult to determine how the incident began. This protester was apparently the father of Zane James. After this, protesters and police both became agitated and the scuffle escalated.

Police made 9 arrests, including the father of Zane James. Police beat multiple protesters with batons and pepper sprayed others. A Cottonwood Heights city councilwoman stated she was struck by police. Police state that one officer was choked to the point of unconsciousness and another was hospitalized. In addition, police state protesters used a water gun filled with "pepper and bodily fluids;" protesters state they were full of water in order to keep cool. A news report also states that some protesters were tased.

### Officer repeatedly uses stun gun on suspect who said he couldn't breathe | 2020-06-05

Bodycam footage shows an unarmed man walking around in the street in Mount Vernon, Virginia. The man allegedly called for oxygen and appears to be in distress, with difficulty communicating his mental state or his medical needs. Another officer arrives on scene and fires his taser at the man. The officer kneels on his neck and continues to tase him. The body cam footage is covered briefly, before showing the other officer pressing his stun gun into the man's neck, then strikes him on the head with the taser. The man screams and attempts to stand. The EMTs assist the police in subduing him, while an officer places his hands in cuffs. Near the end of the footage he can be heard saying, "I can't breathe".

This footage does not appear to be protest related, but demonstrates a severe escalation in force dealing with a man not in a fit mental state.

The officer was placed on administrative leave and was later arrested for unspecified charges related to the incident.

## Manassas

### Officers pepper-spray Virginia state delegate peacefully protesting | 2020-05-30

In this video, delegate Lee Carter asks officers questions about their methods during protests. He stands in the way of an advancing line of law enforcement officers; he is pushed to the ground at 1:30 and pepper-sprayed at 2:27. He also claims to have been hit by a flashbang grenade earlier in the protest (see also third link). At some point (see Facebook video), someone who seems to be the delegate shouts "I'm a member of the general assembly. I write the state police budget. They're gonna fucking regret that."

It is unclear how the protest unfolded, and why the police were advancing on the crowd wearing riot gear; police allege that the protest turned violent and some protesters say that they were tear-gassed or shot at with rubber bullets while peacefully protesting or retreating. (See fourth and fifth links.)

The incident occurred at the intersection of Sudley Road and Sudley Manor Drive near Manassas.

### Officer spits on detained protester | 2020-06-01

A police officer spits on a detained protester who is restrained and sitting on the ground. The officer appears to repeat the action after other protesters mention that he's on camera. Extended footage shows the officer continuing to spit on the protester.

The incident appears to have occurred at the enrance to the Robert E. Lee Memorial roundabout on North Allen Avenue.

After a police investigation, Richmond Police stated that a slow-motion review showed the officer was spitting near, rather than at the protester. The protester responded by asking in the media why the officer was spitting so close to him at all.

### Protester targeted days after protest | 2020-06-05

Footage and reports show approximately 30 police officers in 6-7 squad cars arrive to arrest a woman in a car with her 9 year old child.

Officers arrived on the scene brandishing mace, alleging that the woman assaulted two police officers several days prior. She was dragged from her car and the car was towed from her home.

Officers cited a Star Wars meme depicting a Landspeeder with a caption saying, "This machine kills facists," as intent to kill officers.

The woman states she tried to help a friend who was being shot with rubber bullets.

The woman lives somewhere in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle.

### Woman hit with police projectile resumes breathing after CPR, delivered to hospital | 2020-06-07

Video shows an individual getting hit by a police projectile, falling down, and becoming unresponsive. Medics drag the person away from the police. A medic's first-hand narrative account describes the victim as "a young woman in her 20s." Medics attempt to treat the young woman while police throw flash bang grenades directly into the first aid center where they are gathered. Several times the victim stops responding or breathing but becomes responsive again after CPR. 911 could not send an ambulance. Eventually a civilian transports her by car to an Emergency Dept where she was delivered with a pulse. The person who filmed the incident from his workplace office is an editor at the local alt weekly, The Stranger; he reported in his twitter thread that the people in the office were having trouble breathing from teargas or some other chemical agent.

The incident occurred near 11th and Pine.

### Police arrest journalist | 2020-07-10

First person footage from a photojournalist shows the journalist filming a police car while stating that allegedly the officer in the car said that the officer has the photojournalist's address. The journalist repeats these words back, including the exact phrase, "I have your address." The officer then approaches him and arrests him for threatening an officer, alleging that the journalist claimed to have the officer's address.

The second link shows the full series of events. The photojournalist is filming police as they write parking citations. He is using strong language with the officers and harassing them. However he is doing no more than hurling insults and noting names and badge numbers. At 2:00, it can be verified that the officer does say he has the journalist's address. So, in fact, when he is arrested for threatening an officer, he is repeating the officer's words back to him.

Notably, this journalist filmed the arrest of the individual in wa-seattle-27.

The incident occurred at Jefferson and 5th.

### Officer escalates scuffle by pepper spraying and arresting protester | 2020-11-27

While police are dispersing protesters at E Olive Way and E Denny Way, an officer and an elderly man holding a cane are seen in the street. The officer is pushing the man back across the street and the man is attempting to walk the opposite direction. After the officer pushes the protester to the sidewalk, the officer turns to walk away. The protester then lightly strikes the body-armored officer on the back with his cane; the cane then collapses, suggesting it is a collapsible cane, not capable of striking forcefully. The officer then pepper sprays the protester and tackles him to the ground for arrest.

While it is clear the protester did strike the officer, the question of brutality lies in the force used by the officer: the use of pepper spray and the tackling a man using a cane appear to be disproportionate to the protester's light strike.

### Unidentified man working alongside police hits protesters with baton | 2020-06-22

Video shows police slowly advancing towards protesters, pushing them back. Alongside the police is a man conspicuously wearing "jeans and fatigue-colored ammo belt" wielding a baton. He has no police badge or other identification. He hits and shoves the individual filming. Neither he nor the officers answer when protesters demand to know who the man is and whether he is a cop or a vigilante. A second video in the same twitter thread shows the unidentified man striking a protester and talking with an officer. A third video in the thread shows the man assisting with an arrest. It is unclear whether the police were allowing a civilian without any authority to assault protesters, or whether they were protecting the identity of an officer from some special unit.

He states that police stole all food and other supplies before forcing protesters out. He states that police beat and tear-gassed medics who were attempting to help protesters. In addition, he states that police beat "anyone they could find."

He says that volunteer medics had permission from the church where they set up, but police ignored the permission and dispersed them regardless.

Footage from 3 tiktok videos shows numerous officers (approximately 8) arresting one protester. Protester appears to passively resist by locking his arms. He says, "Sir, I will go with you if you stop grabbing my arms." Other protesters can be heard asking why the man is under arrest.

The protester can be heard screaming in pain as police force him into cuffs. Police then lift him by his limbs and his pants to carry him away.

The third link appears to be the third in chronological order as the protesters arms are already cuffed. It is unclear why he is lying face down in the bushes at the beginning of this clip. It additionally shows the careless and physical manner of arrest used by the police.

Officers then tackled a protester (for reasons unknown) and attempted to take him into custody, with one officer placing a knee on his neck or head for one or two minutes. No officers intervened to get the knee off the man's neck; police formed a barrier to screen the arrest from other protesters and people filming. At the same time, police arrested one other man and hit a woman in the collarbone -- again, for reasons unknown. The man who had an officer's knee on his neck has sued.

### Police use excessive force to disperse protesters | 2020-06-02

Protesters had congregated near the intersection of North 6th Street and McKinley Avenue. Over the course of about an hour, police moved forward, dispersing the protesters using tear gas and rubber bullets, first pushing the protesters a block and a half then pushing them off of North 6th Street entirely. Video shows police shooting rubber bullets at protesters on a sidewalk and firing gas canisters, in large number, at a small group of peaceful protesters. (At least some tear gas was used, but it is unclear how much. Police say they also used smoke canisters.)

Police claim they used force to disperse the crowd after rocks and glass were thrown at them. Police also said at the time that "Molotov cocktails" were thrown at them. They later walked that statement back to say that one Molotov Cocktail was thrown. They say it did not ignite. Media and protesters present say they saw water bottles being thrown, but not glass, rocks, or a Molotov cocktail. Video released by police clearly shows something being thrown at police, but doesn't show what it was. Police also produced a picture of a crushed water bottle and what looks like a water pump and implied it was the remnants of a Molotov cocktail.

NOTE: this incident immediately follows wi-milwaukee-1. Because the misconduct involved is substantially different, it has been given its own incident.

### Police fire tear gas and pepper balls at protesters | 2020-10-07

Protesters rallied in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin after it was announced an officer would not be charged in the death of a black teen, which occurred in February. Protesters threw small projectiles at police and police in riot gear responded with tear gas and impact munitions (believed to be pepper balls). Prior to this, protesters had allegedly thrown objects at residential homes. However, it cannot be confirmed if those rioters were at all related to the group of protesters gassed here.

Bystander vehicles were caught in the gas and had to use the sidewalk to flee.

The incident occurred near North Ave and Menomonie River Parkway.

### National Guard officers violently arrest journalists | 2020-10-08

Several journalists, one independent reporter and several representing The Daily Caller, were sitting in a car in the parking lot of St. Matthew's Evangelical Lutheran Church in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A local news crew captured National Guard officers pulling them from the car, slamming the independent reporter to the pavement. The independent reporter and one Daily Caller reporter were arrested. The independent reporter was held longer than The Daily Caller reporter, but appears to have been released early on October 9th. One Daily Caller reporter also reports being struck with a baton.

Additional footage shows a Daily Caller filming arrests of protesters made by National Guard. The officers tell the Daily Caller reporter to leave the are. He states he is press but returns to his car in the parking lot nonetheless. Officers follow him to his car, causing the incident.

The independent journalist has since tweeted that he sustained a concussion.

### Police violently arrest man in bathrobe for curfew violation | 2020-10-09

Footage was taken at the intersection of N 70th Street and W North Avenue in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. Officers in a passing car yell at an individual on the sidewalk to go inside. The officer clarifies that the filmer is exempt, as "ACLU is fine." The officer then proceeds to arrest the individual on the sidewalk, flipping the individual over his knee, and kneeling on his back. Several officers come to aid in making the arrest. Officers continue to tell the individual to stop resisting, though the individual is pinned to the ground.

It is unclear if the individual was related to a protest, but they appear to be wearing a bathrobe, which might suggest they are not prepared for a protest.
