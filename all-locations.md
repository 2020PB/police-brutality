### Philadelphia Police Trap Protesters on Highway, Then Tear Gas Them and Shoot Rubber Bullets | June 1st

An estimated 3000-5000 protesters moved onto Interstate 676, stopping traffic. Protesters move into a tunnel under 20th street. An eye-witness states that officers inside the tunnel (eastbound on I-676) began shooting rubber bullets and macing protesters without any warning or any instructions to halt the protest on the highway. Protesters clear the tunnel, many kneel and put their hands up. Police shoot tear gas at protesters to disperse the crowd, they escape to the hill between 20th and 21st street as there was tear gas westbound on the interstate and they were still being fired at by officers in the tunnel to the east. Some throw canisters back. Officers chase protesters up the hill and appear to detain a number of them. Other officers continue to fire tear gas on to the hill, despite the only visible escape from the tear gas being over a ~10 ft fence.

### Woman hit with police projectile resumes breathing after CPR, delivered to hospital | June 7th

Medics attempt to treat "a young woman in her 20s who had taken a police projectile to her chest" as police throw flash bang grenades directly into the first aid center. There were several cycles of the victim no longer responding or breathing but becoming responsive again after CPR. 911 could not send an ambulance. Eventually a civilian transported her by car to the ED where she was delivered with a pulse. The filmer, an editor at the local alt weekly The Stranger, reported in his twitter thread that the people in the office from where he was filming were having trouble breathing.
